This repository contains AI generated summaries of each episode of the podcast Pop Culture Parenting. Each file covers a single episode and has a summary of the episode, an actionable cheat sheet and some key words to enable searching. 

I'm a massive fan of the podcast but wanted a way to solidify my understand of each episode and, when faced with a particular parenting challenge go back through the back catalog and find a relevant episode for tips. So, I wrote some code to generate these summaries, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/lekkerdriveway/podcast-processor)
