## Changing Children's Behaviors Cheat Sheet

### 1. Choose Your Battles Strategically
- Focus on one challenging behavior at a time rather than trying to fix everything
- Select either the most difficult daily pressure point OR an "easy win" to build momentum
- Expect to see positive changes within a month of implementing a consistent strategy
- If you've been trying the same approach for months/years without success, it's time to adjust
- Recognize when expectations may be too high (asking for a "dunk" when they need to learn dribbling)

### 2. Create Positive Associations with Routine Tasks
- Spend 30 seconds of positive interaction during typically challenging activities (diaper changes, clothing changes)
- "Uncouple" negative associations by adding enjoyable elements to previously stressful situations
- For mealtimes, add playfulness rather than pressure (example: toy performance cheering child on)
- Remember that hurrying through tasks often creates resistance that actually takes longer
- Focus on the relationship and connection during these moments, not just compliance

### 3. Direct Toward Desired Behaviors
- Replace "stop that" statements with clear guidance about what to do instead
- For nose-picking, teach "we blow our noses" rather than just saying "stop picking"
- Immediately reinforce when the child shows the desired behavior
- Use positive language: "Hands stay down" vs. "Don't touch your nose"
- Create family narratives: "We're all working on this together" rather than singling out the child

### 4. Handle Your Own Regulation First
- When you feel overwhelmed, prioritize safety above all else
- Recognize when you're beyond capacity and simply name it to yourself: "This is happening"
- Take a brief walk-away moment if needed (ensuring children are safe)
- Drop the demand level when necessary (example: reheating food instead of cooking fresh)
- Create small moments of connection and joy even during busy days (15 minutes at the park)

### 5. Understand Different Behaviors with Different Parents
- Children often use different strategies with each parent based on what has worked before
- When behaviors differ dramatically between parents, both approaches may need adjustment
- Create a "third strategy" that works when both parents are present
- Focus on being on the same team with your child rather than in opposition
- For specific tasks, establish consistency in approach between caregivers

### 6. Address Self-Sabotage and Control Issues
- Recognize when a child's need for control trumps "doing the right thing"
- Children may choose predictable negative outcomes over uncertain positive ones
- For school settings, give students with behavioral challenges leadership roles
- Channel control needs into positive pathways (creating rules, monitoring progress)
- Build skills in empathy and perspective-taking through guided leadership opportunities

### 7. Remember the Relationship Foundation
- Children test boundaries more with adults they feel safe with
- View boundary-pushing as a sign of a secure relationship, not failure
- Maintain unconditional positive regard during non-challenging times
- Connect before correcting in emotional moments
- Acknowledge that the joy and connection must come before behavioral compliance
