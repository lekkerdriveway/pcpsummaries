## Raising Emotionally Healthy Boys Cheat Sheet

### 1. Supporting Emotional Expression
- Normalize all emotions - explicitly tell boys that crying is healthy and natural
- Model appropriate emotional expression by showing your own vulnerability
- Challenge the societal message that "boys don't cry" by discussing examples in media
- Praise boys when they express sadness, fear or disappointment appropriately
- Avoid phrases that reinforce emotional suppression (like "toughen up" or "be a man")
- Recognize that mainstream culture may contradict your messaging - acknowledge this contradiction and discuss it openly

### 2. Teaching Conflict Resolution Without Aggression
- Establish clear universal rules: "Nobody can hit you, and you cannot hit anybody"
- When conflicts occur, first connect with the child who's acting out before correcting behavior
- Help children calm their bodies when upset rather than immediately imposing consequences
- Model appropriate responses to conflict (staying calm even when provoked)
- Validate feelings while redirecting behavior: "I understand you're angry, but we use words not hands"
- Teach alternative expressions for anger such as roaring, stomping, or using words
- Celebrate when children resolve conflicts peacefully on their own
