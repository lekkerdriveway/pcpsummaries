## Understanding Attachment Cheat Sheet

### 1. What Attachment Really Means
- Attachment describes how early relationships with caregivers inform fundamental beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world
- Secure attachment means a child believes they are worthy of love, that others can be trusted, and that the world is safe to explore
- At its simplest, secure attachment answers two questions: "Can I count on people?" and "Am I worthy of love?"
- Attachment isn't just built by parenting style—environmental stressors like poverty or trauma can fracture attachment
- A secure attachment is determined by how the child feels, not how the parent feels about the relationship

### 2. Building Secure Attachment Day-to-Day
- Respond consistently and sensitively to children's emotional needs
- Practice "wondering about" your child instead of directly asking: "I wonder what's happening for this little one right now"
- Verbalize your love during times of distress: "I love you" is powerful when a child is upset
- Remember that boundaries are an essential part of secure attachment—they create consistency and predictability
- Focus on delighting in your child, celebrating their achievements, and demonstrating they are valued

### 3. Overcoming Attachment Challenges
- Postnatal depression affects approximately 20% of parents and can challenge attachment, but doesn't guarantee insecure attachment
- If you've struggled with postnatal depression, focus on rebuilding connection through responsiveness and delighting in your child
- If you experienced insecure attachment in your own childhood, seek support for your trauma while being mindful of your child's needs
- Remember that every child needs at least one consistent, predictable caregiver to develop secure attachment
- Repair ruptures in the relationship by taking primary responsibility as the adult (children shouldn't be responsible for repairing)

### 4. Sleep Training and Attachment
- Sleep training isn't the same as "crying it out" and doesn't necessarily damage attachment
- Being physically present during sleep training (like sitting in the room) maintains attachment while teaching self-soothing
- Prioritize parental mental health—severe sleep deprivation can impact your ability to be responsive and attuned
- Adapt sleep approaches based on the individual child's temperament and needs
- Transitional objects (like stuffed animals) help children learn to self-soothe and don't replace attachment to caregivers

### 5. Navigating Childcare and Separation
- Quality childcare can support secure attachment, with girls generally adapting more easily than boys
- High-quality childcare means appropriate ratios, well-trained educators who respond sensitively to individual children
- It's normal for children to cry when reunited with parents—this "proximity seeking" behavior actually indicates secure attachment
- Children who appear indifferent upon pickup aren't necessarily insecurely attached—they may be engaged in their activities
- Foster connections with specific educators at childcare who can serve as secure attachment figures during the day

### 6. Parenting Without Shame
- There's no single "right way" to parent—focus on what works for your unique child
- Secure attachment isn't about being perfect—it's about repair, consistency, and responding to your child's individual needs
- Avoid comparing your child's behavior to others—temperament differences are normal and don't indicate attachment problems
- Remember that attachment is just one part of a complex developmental equation (along with temperament, environment, etc.)
- Be gentle with yourself—attachment is built over time through consistent relationship patterns, not individual moments
