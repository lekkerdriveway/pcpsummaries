## Changing Challenging Behaviors Cheat Sheet

### 1. Self-Regulation for Parents
- Notice physical signs when you're getting stressed (tense muscles, jutting jaw)
- Drop expectations when necessary and use "Plan B" to create space for calm
- Remember that if you escalate, it will make the situation worse
- Create brief moments to reset (even a 5-minute screen time break can help)
- Prioritize connection over immediate compliance, especially during pressure points

### 2. Understanding Repetitive Behaviors in Autistic Children
- Identify if behaviors are expressions of joy versus safe havens from overwhelming stimuli
- Look for whether the child is expanding/exploring or shutting down their world
- Consult occupational therapists to identify sensory seeking vs. sensory avoidance patterns
- Offer alternative sensory activities that provide similar sensations in safer ways
- Focus on why the behavior is happening before trying to change it

### 3. Supporting Children with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA)
- "Stand next to them, run with them, then turn them" - avoid direct confrontation
- Build trust before attempting to guide behavior
- Focus first on connection and seeing their perspective
- Demonstrate you're "on the same side" as the child
- Lead with warmth and genuine interest before addressing behavior concerns

### 4. Encouraging Success and Effort
- Ensure children experience success in areas they care about
- If a child isn't trying in activities (sports, school), investigate whether they've experienced success elsewhere
- Help children identify specific areas where they can succeed through effort
- Build confidence through accomplishment in low-pressure environments first
- Remember that children who don't experience success stop trying to avoid failure

### 5. Managing Physical Play and Setting Boundaries
- Don't prohibit wrestling/rough play, but create structure around it
- Teach consent: "Both people need to be happy to participate"
- Practice checking in: "Are you still happy to keep going?"
- Use physical play as an opportunity to teach emotional awareness
- Set clear boundaries about when and where rough play is appropriate

### 6. Addressing Unwanted Behaviors Effectively
- Focus on replacing the unwanted behavior rather than stopping it
- For teenagers, use motivational interviewing - help them find their own reasons to change
- Connect with what matters to the child, then guide them toward strategies that achieve positive outcomes
- For babies and toddlers, prioritize attachment and connection
- Recognize when unwanted behaviors (like sibling aggression) indicate a need for more quality connection time
