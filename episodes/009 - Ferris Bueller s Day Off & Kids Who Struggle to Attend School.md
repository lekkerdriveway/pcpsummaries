## Supporting Children Who Struggle with School Attendance Cheat Sheet

### 1. Recognizing the Warning Signs
- Watch for patterns of withdrawal, decreased social engagement, or reduced enthusiasm about school activities
- Pay attention to physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches) that repeatedly occur on school days—these are real physical manifestations of anxiety, not made-up excuses
- Notice timing patterns: Is it only certain days, subjects, or with specific teachers?
- Be alert to changes in a previously engaged child becoming withdrawn
- Monitor for avoidance of specific school situations (playground, bathrooms, lunchtime, presentations)

### 2. Understanding What's Really Happening
- Children aren't simply "avoiding school"—they're avoiding specific triggers within the school environment
- Two major peak periods for school attendance struggles: early-mid primary (separation anxiety) and transitioning to high school (social anxiety)
- Consider what might be happening at home that unintentionally reinforces staying home (special one-on-one time, reduced expectations)
- Look beyond the attendance problem for underlying issues: learning difficulties, anxiety, social challenges, or family dynamics
- Recognize that anxious children often catastrophize situations and underestimate their ability to cope

### 3. Supporting Successful School Transitions
- Prepare children for transitions by visiting new environments beforehand and meeting teachers
- Create familiarity by pointing out connections with other children and staff they already know
- For high school transitions, help organize practical aspects like timetables, room locations, and materials
- Build gradual exposure to challenging aspects of the school environment
- Establish predictable routines that provide security during transitions

### 4. Building Coping Skills
- Don't dismiss physical symptoms or simply say "you'll be fine"—acknowledge their feelings
- Help children recognize catastrophizing thought patterns and consider alternative outcomes
- Teach specific coping strategies they can use when feeling anxious at school
- Practice problem-solving skills for social situations outside the moment of stress
- Focus on building incremental successes rather than expecting immediate full attendance

### 5. When and How to Get Help
- Early intervention leads to better outcomes—don't wait until the problem becomes severe
- Work collaboratively with the school to identify triggers and develop supportive strategies
- Consider whether there are secondary gains (benefits from staying home) that need addressing
- Seek professional support if attendance problems persist despite your efforts
- Remember that addressing attendance issues early is linked to better long-term outcomes in adulthood
