## Parental Mental Health Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Mental Health as a Parent
- Nearly 50% of adults will experience mental illness in their lifetime; prevalence is higher among parents
- Approximately 25% of children in Australia live with a parent experiencing mental health challenges
- Core symptoms of depression include persistent low mood AND/OR inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities
- Physical symptoms include disrupted sleep, changes in appetite, and low energy
- Mental illness must impact function (ability to perform normal activities) for at least two weeks
- Experiencing mental health challenges doesn't mean you're failing as a parent

### 2. Recognizing When You Need Support
- Watch for changes in your baseline functioning (struggling with tasks you previously managed well)
- Notice if you've stopped enjoying activities that previously brought pleasure
- Be aware of persistent physical symptoms like disrupted sleep, changes in appetite, or constant fatigue
- Pay attention to disorganization, difficulty concentrating, or low self-esteem
- Recognize that stigma (both from others and self-imposed) is one of the biggest barriers to seeking help
- Life events (job loss, bereavement) may trigger mental health issues but don't make them any less real or worthy of treatment

### 3. Building Connection and Support Networks
- Social connection is one of the strongest predictors of good mental health
- Make time for relationships outside of parenting responsibilities
- Create opportunities for genuine connection with your children beyond functional caretaking
- Share parenting responsibilities when possible to allow each parent mental health breaks
- Maintain friendships and social outlets that aren't focused solely on parenting
- Remember that seeking help isn't a sign of weakness but an empowering step toward better parenting

### 4. Practical Self-Care Strategies
- Prioritize physical activity and time outside, even if it's just a short walk
- Rediscover activities you enjoyed before becoming a parent, even in modified form
- Practice "good enough" parenting rather than perfectionism (occasional Griswold moments are normal)
- Plan regular breaks, even brief ones (like Nick's car park escapes)
- Incorporate playful activities that serve both your needs and your child's
- Schedule actual downtime rather than filling all available moments with tasks
- Consider visiting playgrounds, parks or other child-friendly spaces that also allow you to experience joy

### 5. Getting Professional Help
- Start with your general practitioner for an initial assessment and referral options
- Consider both medication and non-medication approaches based on individual needs
- Recognize that getting help benefits not just you but your children as well
- Early intervention is key - don't wait until crisis point
- Mental health treatment has improved dramatically but continues to evolve
- Address misconceptions: mental health challenges following life events still deserve treatment
- Remember that improving parental mental health is one of the most important factors in improving children's outcomes
