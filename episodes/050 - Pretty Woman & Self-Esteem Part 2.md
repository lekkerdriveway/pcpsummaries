## Building Healthy Self-Esteem Cheat Sheet

### 1. Recognizing Healthy Self-Esteem in Children
- Look for social competence appropriate to the child's temperament (not all kids need to be instantly social at the playground)
- Watch how they handle setbacks—healthy self-esteem allows children to recover from disappointments without complete devastation
- Notice their ability to navigate conflicts and repair relationships after disagreements
- Understand that self-esteem develops from security in relationships first, then competence in valued skills
- Focus on behaviors rather than physical attributes when giving praise ("I like how you helped that child" vs "you look pretty")

### 2. Creating the Foundation Through Secure Relationships
- Distinguish between correcting behaviors and criticizing the child's identity ("That behavior isn't like you" vs "What's wrong with you?")
- Demonstrate unconditional positive regard—show that your relationship isn't contingent on perfect behavior
- Model healthy conflict resolution in your own relationships
- Create opportunities for "scaffolded success" in social situations (like helping a child navigate playground conflicts)
- Balance correction with specific, genuine praise about things that matter (4:1 ratio of positive to negative feedback)

### 3. Supporting Self-Esteem During Skill Development
- Focus on the process rather than outcomes ("I noticed how hard you worked" vs "Good job winning")
- Allow children to guide the pace when learning challenging skills like bike riding
- Recognize the "zone of proximal development"—push gently beyond current abilities without causing distress
- Keep activities enjoyable rather than stressful—children who stop having fun will resist future attempts
- Celebrate small steps of progress rather than just the end goal

### 4. Meeting Children Where They Are
- Recognize that not all children express feelings verbally—watch their behaviors as indicators of self-esteem
- Avoid pressuring children to open up when they're not comfortable doing so
- Maintain open communication pathways without judgment so children know they can come to you
- Adapt your approach to the child's temperament rather than expecting them to match yours
- Remember that children with neurodevelopmental differences (ADHD, autism) may need different measures of success and support

### 5. Building Resilience Against External Challenges
- Create proactively protective environments at school and home rather than only reacting to problems
- Address bullying as a community issue rather than an individual child's problem to solve
- Help children diversify sources of self-worth across multiple domains (not just academics or sports)
- Use the "Pygmalion effect"—create positive narratives about capabilities that help children fulfill their potential
- Guide children toward attributing their worth to factors they can control (effort, kindness) rather than physical appearance or outcomes

### 6. Modeling Healthy Self-Esteem as Parents
- Demonstrate working on your own self-esteem ("I felt disappointed about not getting that job, but I know I'm valuable in many ways")
- Show humility as a component of self-esteem, not its opposite
- Balance honest self-assessment with self-compassion
- Diversify your own sources of identity and worth beyond parenting
- Build self-esteem through purposeful generosity to others and invite children to participate when they show interest
