## Building Children's Self-Esteem Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understand How Self-Esteem Develops
- Self-esteem begins emerging around ages 3-5 when children start developing self-awareness
- There's often a vulnerable period around ages 8-10 when children realize they may not excel at everything
- Self-esteem typically improves during adolescence as teens gain more autonomy over their choices
- Low self-esteem in childhood can increase vulnerability to depression, anxiety and eating disorders later
- Remember that self-esteem fluctuates throughout the day and throughout life

### 2. Focus on Who Children Are, Not What They Do
- Help children understand they are not defined solely by their achievements or abilities
- Use language that separates performance from identity: "You missed that shot" rather than "You're not good at basketball"
- Create narratives that emphasize character traits: kindness, perseverance, compassion
- Avoid making your love or approval contingent on performance or success
- As one parent in the episode shared: "I'm not proud because you're successful; I'm proud because you're a good person"

### 3. Validate All Emotions
- Acknowledge that all feelings are valid: "It is valid for you to be angry, it is valid for you to be jealous"
- Show children pathways to recovery from difficult emotions
- Don't dismiss or minimize feelings with statements like "you're fine" or "it's not a big deal"
- Watch for moments when your child "freezes" after criticismâ€”this can indicate a self-esteem vulnerability
- Model healthy emotional expression and regulation in your own behavior

### 4. Celebrate Effort Over Success
- Specifically praise the effort and process rather than just outcomes
- Say things like "I saw how hard you tried" instead of just "great job winning"
- Help children see failure as an opportunity for growth rather than a reflection of their worth
- Share examples of your own failures and what you learned from them
- Create opportunities for them to experience appropriate challenges they can overcome with effort

### 5. Foster Strong Social Connections
- Help children build and maintain healthy friendships
- Point out when they are being good friends to others
- Create opportunities for them to feel belonging in groups and communities
- Remember that social relationships become protective factors for self-esteem
- Teach children to recognize when relationships are healthy versus when they damage self-esteem

### 6. Provide Unconditional Support
- Never use shame or humiliation as disciplinary tools
- Avoid "ribbing" or teasing that might seem harmless to you but can damage their self-perception
- Ensure children know they are loved regardless of their achievements or failures
- Be aware that seemingly casual comments can deeply impact a child's developing self-image
- Create a secure base from which they can explore and take appropriate risks

### 7. Recognize Signs of Self-Esteem Issues
- Watch for excessive self-criticism or perfectionism
- Notice if your child is hypersensitive to failure
- Be concerned if they blame others for their mistakes
- Observe if they avoid challenges for fear of not being perfect
- Take seriously any comments that suggest they view themselves negatively
