## Supporting Kids Through a Pandemic Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understand the Impact of Complex Trauma
- Recognize that a pandemic is a form of "complex trauma" - ongoing, uncertain, with no clear end point
- Acknowledge that kids may be struggling even if they appear physically fine
- Different children show stress in different ways - some are vocal while others internalize
- Watch for behavioral changes that might signal distress (sleep issues, withdrawal, increased questions about safety)
- Remember that for young children (like a 3-year-old), a two-year pandemic represents most of their conscious life

### 2. Create Connection Before Solutions
- Get down to children's physical level when talking about difficult topics
- Don't immediately try to "fix" their feelings or rush to solutions
- Observe their behavior and create gentle opportunities for conversation
- Show care through actions (like Ripley cleaning Newt) rather than just words
- Allow children to set the pace of conversation about difficult topics

### 3. Be Honest About Uncertainty
- It's okay to say "I don't know" when children ask when the pandemic will end
- Focus conversations on what you do know and can control
- Validate their feelings without minimizing them ("I find it hard to think about that too")
- Share age-appropriate information without overwhelming them
- Reassure them about the constants in their life ("I will always be here for you")

### 4. Maintain Protective Factors
- Preserve relationships within and outside the family when possible (even virtually)
- Create consistent routines that provide structure and predictability
- Facilitate connections with important non-parental adults (teachers, coaches, extended family)
- Recognize that younger children rely more on family relationships, while older kids need peer connections
- Find creative ways to maintain community involvement and sense of belonging

### 5. Care for Yourself as a Parent
- Remember you're a person first, then a partner, then a parent
- Schedule regular breaks, even if brief (like sitting in a car for 30 minutes alone)
- Acknowledge when you're feeling overwhelmed and seek support
- Recognize that pandemic parenting is harder - lower your expectations accordingly
- Model self-care openly so children learn these skills too

### 6. Build Resilience Through Support
- Resilience isn't about "toughing it out" but learning to get back up with support
- Talk openly about your own coping strategies (exercise, connecting with friends)
- Celebrate small victories during difficult times
- Reflect on periods of struggle once they've passed ("That was hard but we got through it")
- Help children identify what helped them through previous challenges

### 7. Share Your Own Feelings Appropriately
- Show children that adults have emotions too
- Model healthy expression of difficult feelings
- Avoid overwhelming children with adult problems or excessive anxiety
- Demonstrate how to name emotions and work through them
- Be honest about finding things difficult while maintaining a sense of safety
