## Connection Cheat Sheet

### 1. Prioritize Connection Before Co-regulation
- Connection must come before attempting to co-regulate a distressed child
- When a child is upset, first ask: "What do they emotionally need right now?"
- Resist the urge to immediately solve problems or enforce compliance
- Connection signals safety and opens the door to cooperation
- Example: Instead of saying "Stop crying," try "I wish you were feeling better right now"

### 2. Connect Through the Emotional Brain, Not the Logical Brain
- The emotional brain should lead, with the logical brain supporting, not the other way around
- When you focus on tasks, rules, or compliance, you activate the logical brain
- Play, joy, and shared experiences activate emotional connection
- Notice when you've switched to "logical mode" (giving orders, seeking compliance)
- Example: Transform a tense bedtime by acknowledging "You really wish we could do something fun right now instead of go to bed, don't you?"

### 3. Bank Emotional Connections During Calm Times
- Build a reservoir of positive emotional connections during peaceful moments
- The more frequent positive emotional connections, the stronger your relationship
- These banked connections become resources during challenging moments
- Spend at least 5-10 minutes daily in child-led play with no agenda
- Example: Create a simple obstacle course or game that produces shared joy and laughter

### 4. Meet Children Where They Are Emotionally
- Honor regression (acting younger) as a request for emotional safety
- If a child is pretending to be a baby or animal, join their world rather than correcting them
- Allow for emotional expression without judgment
- Resist comments like "You're not a baby" or "Stop using that voice"
- Example: When a child is meowing like a cat, respond playfully in their world instead of demanding normal behavior

### 5. Use Presence and Calm Instead of Words and Logic
- Sometimes fewer words create better connection
- Your calm presence can be more powerful than explanations
- Aim to have a child "catch the calm off you" rather than explaining why they should be calm
- Physical closeness without demands creates safety
- Example: Sit quietly next to a distressed child without immediately asking what's wrong

### 6. Create Connection Through Shared Goals
- Frame situations in terms of what you both want, not what you want from them
- Acknowledge their perspective before stating yours
- Use phrases like "We both want..." or "I wish we could..."
- Find the overlapping goal beneath the conflict
- Example: "I know we both want to have a good time today. This isn't working right now. What do you think would help?"

### 7. Recognize When Connection is Blocked by Safety Concerns
- Connection is impossible when someone feels unsafe (physically or emotionally)
- Notice when your own stress is causing you to focus on control rather than connection
- Be sensitive to what emotions the child is experiencing, even difficult ones
- Accept all emotions while setting limits on harmful behaviors
- Example: "You can be angry, that's totally okay, but hitting isn't safe. Let's find another way to show how mad you are."
