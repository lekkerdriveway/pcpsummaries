# Episode 7: Remember the Titans & Parenting Without Shame

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss how to parent without using shame, in the context of the film "Remember the Titans." Responding to a listener question, they explore the negative impacts of shame on children's development while explaining Erik Erikson's developmental theory, particularly the autonomy versus shame stage that occurs between ages 1.5 to 3-4. Billy provides evidence-based approaches for giving children feedback without challenging their sense of self-worth, while Nick reflects on how challenging this can be in practice. They analyze two contrasting coaching styles in Remember the Titans to illustrate their points about supportive versus shame-based guidance.

## Parenting Without Shame Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Shame vs. Constructive Guidance
- Shame challenges who the child is as a person ("I can't believe you did that," "What's wrong with you?")
- Shame causes withdrawal, threatens self-esteem, and reduces learning opportunity
- Focus on the specific behavior rather than the child's character or identity
- Remember that kids aged 1.5-4 are developing autonomy and need support, not shame
- When a child makes a mistake, ask yourself: "What's going on for this little one?" rather than assuming bad intentions

### 2. Using Language That Builds Rather Than Breaks
- Separate emotions from actions: "It's OK to feel angry, but it's not OK to hit your brother"
- Avoid comparative language: "Your brother can do this, why can't you?"
- Replace "There's no excuse for this" with "Let's understand what happened"
- Avoid asking questions when you don't actually want an answer ("Why would you do that?")
- Use "we" language to create partnership: "Next time, we'll figure it out together"

### 3. Responding to Mistakes Constructively
- When toilet training accidents happen: "It's alright, we probably didn't notice soon enough"
- For missed responsibilities: "What happened that made this difficult? How can we do better next time?"
- With social conflicts: "I know you can do better than that. Think about how the other person feels"
- Never shame bodily functions or development that children cannot fully control
- Remember: every mistake is an opportunity to develop a skill, not an opportunity to punish

### 4. Supporting Healthy Autonomy
- Allow age-appropriate choices (clothing, food preferences) when safety isn't at risk
- Consider whether your correction is necessary - ask "Will this harm the child?" before intervening
- Recognize physical cues before verbal ones (wiggling before saying they need the bathroom)
- Guide children toward success rather than expecting them to figure everything out alone
- Build on strengths: "I know you can do this" creates confidence for future challenges

### 5. Modeling Healthy Responses to Failure
- Show children that making mistakes is a normal part of learning
- Demonstrate reflective thinking: "That didn't work well. What could I do differently?"
- Acknowledge when you've made a mistake in your parenting approach
- Use failures as opportunities to strengthen your relationship, not damage it
- Remember that consistency matters more than perfection - you'll have many opportunities to get it right

### 6. Working with Sensitive Children
- Recognize that some children are more prone to feeling shame than others
- High-energy, extroverted children can be particularly vulnerable to shame
- Pressure does not improve performance for most children
- Break challenges down into small, manageable steps when children feel overwhelmed
- Focus on small wins: "Just cover number 23" versus "Win the whole game"
