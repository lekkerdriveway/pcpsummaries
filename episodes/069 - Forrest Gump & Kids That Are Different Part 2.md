## Supporting Children Who Are Different Cheat Sheet

### 1. Focus on Strengths, Not Deficits
- Ask two key questions about any child: "What do they enjoy?" and "What are they good at?"
- When introducing children to others, highlight their interests and strengths rather than their challenges
- Recognize that every child has hundreds of strengths—our job is to elevate these
- Avoid pity-based language ("Isn't it amazing they did X despite their disability?")
- Emphasize that differences in abilities don't determine quality of life or opportunities

### 2. Creating Genuine Inclusion
- Find activities where children with different abilities can participate together
- Scaffold participation so all children can be included at their ability level
- Focus on building common ground rather than emphasizing differences
- Role model inclusive behavior (if your child says someone is "weird," show them how to be inclusive)
- Expose children to diverse people and relationships from an early age
- Look for ways to adapt activities rather than excluding children who can't fully participate

### 3. Using Appropriate Language
- Use person-first language in most cases ("a child with autism" rather than "an autistic child")
- Respect that some communities may prefer different terminology—follow their lead
- Avoid outdated, derogatory terminology
- Consult resources like those from People with Disabilities Australia for current language guidance
- Correct inappropriate language gently while teaching more inclusive alternatives
- Remember "nothing about us without us"—include people with disabilities in conversations about language

### 4. Supporting Children's Self-Awareness about Differences
- Validate feelings when children notice they're different: "Yes, I understand that feels hard"
- After validation, help them identify and focus on their strengths
- Create opportunities for children to succeed in areas where they excel
- Show children they're valued outside of challenging moments (not just when struggling)
- Help children build internal mechanisms to recover from difficult feelings
- Use age-appropriate books to spark conversations about differences (recommendations: "All Bodies are Good Bodies," "A Friend Like Mine," "When Charlie Met Emma")

### 5. Handling Diagnoses and Medical Support
- Present assessments and diagnoses as tools to help, not labels that define
- Do preparation work before diagnosis—ensure the child understands why you're seeking support
- Frame it positively: "We're doing this so everyone can figure out how to help when you're struggling"
- Compare to wearing glasses—accommodation rather than trying harder
- Recognize that diagnoses don't change who the child is; they help others understand how to support them
- Remember the goal is accommodation where necessary and skill building where possible

### 6. Creating Inclusive Communities
- Recognize that most barriers are attitudinal rather than based on actual limitations
- Support educators who want to learn but may lack training in inclusion
- Challenge rigid systems while working with individuals within those systems
- Provide opportunities for your child to build diverse relationships
- Remember that inclusive practices benefit all children, not just those with differences
- Role model how to transform exclusionary language ("she's too little") into inclusive solutions ("here's how she can participate")
