## Screen Time Management Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Screen Time Concerns
- Screen obsession isn't a new phenomenon—it's portrayed in Willy Wonka (1971) through the character Mike TV
- Current guidelines recommend: no screens under age 2, 1 hour max for ages 2-5, 2 hours max for over 5 years
- About 80% of families exceed these guidelines—focus on quality over guilt about quantity
- The primary concern isn't screen time itself, but what children aren't doing when using screens (social interaction, language practice, physical activity)
- Watch for increased screen time as a potential indicator of mental health struggles in older children

### 2. Content Matters More Than Time
- Know exactly what your children are watching across all age ranges
- For young children, curated content like ABC Kids is preferable to unfiltered content
- For older children, understand the platforms they use and the social communities they engage with
- Be especially vigilant about content on mobile devices where children can quickly switch between apps
- Set up parental controls and content filters appropriate to your child's age

### 3. Managing Screen Time Transitions
- Meltdowns when turning off screens are common and challenging for parents
- Plan transitions in advance—give warnings before screen time ends
- Avoid screen use immediately before bedtime as it disrupts sleep quality
- Consider using screen time as a reward after completing other activities rather than as the default activity
- Establish consistent rules about when screens are allowed (e.g., weekends during sibling nap time)

### 4. The Displacement Effect
- Screen time often replaces other developmental activities
- Screen learning is not equivalent to in-person learning—parents provide feedback, correction, and nonverbal cues that screens cannot
- Language development particularly suffers when screens replace interaction with caregivers
- Physical activity is often reduced when screen time increases
- Social skills like reading body language and facial expressions develop through real interaction

### 5. Modeling Healthy Screen Behaviors
- Children watch how parents use their own devices
- Be conscious of your own screen habits and how they might influence your children
- Consider implementing "screen-free times" for the whole family (meals, certain hours, etc.)
- Engage in screen activities together when appropriate—co-viewing allows for discussion and context
- Remember that occasional screen time is not harmful—balance is key
