## Mental Health First Aid Cheat Sheet

### 1. Preparing Yourself to Help
- Check your own emotional state before approaching a distressed child
- Consider if you're the right person or if someone with a stronger relationship might be better
- Recognize and set aside your own biases (e.g., "they're making a fuss over nothing")
- Remember that unconditional support means not expecting appreciation in return
- If possible, gather information about the situation from others who know the child

### 2. Creating a Safe Approach
- Use a calm, low voice when speaking to the distressed child
- Approach at a 45-degree angle rather than standing directly in front
- Avoid backing children into corners—never block their exit route
- Ask permission before moving closer: "Is it okay if I sit next to you?"
- Position yourself at or below their eye level to appear less threatening
- Keep your hands visible with open palms to signal safety
- Monitor their body language and adjust your approach accordingly

### 3. Establishing Connection
- Start with genuine empathy: "I'm really worried about you"
- Use open-ended questions rather than leading ones: "Can you tell me what happened?"
- Create comfortable silence—don't rush to fill quiet moments
- Give your full attention—put away phones and eliminate distractions
- Communicate that this is a safe space for as long as they need
- For less urgent situations, offer choices about when to talk: "Is now a good time or would later be better?"
- Validate their emotions without minimizing: "It's definitely not okay what happened"

### 4. Maintaining Support
- Watch for signs the child is getting tense or uncomfortable with your proximity
- Avoid dismissive phrases like "It'll be okay" or "Toughen up"
- Remember that aggressive behavior often masks deeper distress
- When appropriate, explain what will happen next to provide predictability
- Stay present even when the child isn't responding immediately
- Be responsive to their needs rather than following a rigid script
- Focus on keeping them safe until the crisis passes or professional help arrives

### 5. Recognizing Mental Health Warning Signs
- Persistent low mood lasting more than two weeks
- Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities
- Increased agitation or being easily tipped over the edge
- Social withdrawal or isolation
- Expressions of worthlessness, excessive guilt, or hopelessness
- Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels
- Physical complaints like headaches or stomach pain without medical cause
- Any significant behavioral change from their normal patterns
- Statements about self-harm or suicidal thoughts require immediate action
