## Understanding and Addressing Bullying Cheat Sheet

### 1. Defining Real Bullying
- True bullying has three components: intention to cause harm, repetitive behavior, and a power imbalance
- Distinguish bullying from one-time conflicts or unintentional hurtful behavior
- The person experiencing the behavior is the key determinant of whether it's harmful
- Cultural norms like "teasing" or "ribbing" are not harmless if they consistently hurt someone
- When children aren't aware their behavior is hurtful, give them a chance to change before labeling it as bullying

### 2. Starting Conversations About Bullying
- Begin discussing bullying when children enter primary school (around age 5-6), not waiting until incidents occur
- Use developmentally appropriate language: "That must not feel nice for that child" rather than complex explanations
- Ask open-ended questions: "What would you do if you saw someone being mean to another child on purpose?"
- Point out examples in daily life: "Did you notice how that child looked sad when they weren't included?"
- Normalize coming to adults with concerns without fear of being labeled a "snitch"

### 3. Supporting a Child Who's Being Bullied
- Validate their feelings first: "That must feel awful" before moving to solutions
- Collect specific information: when/where it happens, who was present, whether they told anyone
- Don't expect young children to resolve bullying independently—form alliances with teachers/coaches
- Teach them it's not their responsibility to fix the situation
- Sometimes children misinterpret situations as bullying—validate their feelings but gently guide their understanding

### 4. Responding to Physical Violence
- Don't encourage children to "stand up for themselves" physically against bullies
- Physical retaliation can actually reinforce bullying as the bully gets the reaction they want
- Children who lash out physically often become further socially isolated
- Many bullies misinterpret neutral situations as aggressive, creating cycles of conflict
- Focus on safe reporting and adult intervention instead of physical solutions

### 5. Teaching Bystander Intervention
- Start with the easiest intervention: walking away rather than being part of the audience
- Next level: walking away and telling a trusted adult
- Advanced: directly showing disapproval ("That's not nice" or "We don't treat people like that")
- Create a family culture that values speaking up when others are being mistreated
- Acknowledge that intervention is difficult and requires building confidence over time

### 6. If Your Child Is Friends With a Bully
- Don't simply forbid the friendship ("Don't be friends with Billy")—this rarely works
- Instead, discuss expectations for how friends should treat each other and others
- Ask questions: "Why do you think this person has such influence?" or "How do you feel when they treat others that way?"
- Look for underlying issues—is your child only able to make friends with antisocial peers?
- Recognize that social dynamics often need to be addressed at a community level, not just individual relationships

### 7. If Your Child Is Bullying Others
- View this as an opportunity for growth rather than just feeling devastated
- Investigate why the behavior is occurring: lacking social skills? misinterpreting others' intentions?
- Assess if your child needs support with empathy development or emotional regulation
- Create opportunities for them to practice positive social leadership
- Reinforce quickly when they demonstrate appropriate behavior

### 8. Evidence-Based School Approaches
- Be cautious of anti-bullying programs that aren't evidence-based (some make situations worse)
- The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program has the strongest evidence base
- Effective programs involve the entire school community, not just "problem children"
- Focus on the ~15% of socially influential students who shape peer norms
- Regularly collect data on bullying prevalence and children's comfort reporting issues
- Create clear, consistent procedures for addressing bullying incidents

### 9. Approaching Parents of Children Who Bully
- Build positive relationships with all parents before issues arise
- Open with curious questions: "How do you think [child's name] is doing?"
- Frame concerns positively: "We know [child] can do better than this behavior"
- Emphasize collaboration: "Let's put our heads together to support them"
- Allow time for parents to process—many will initially be defensive or in denial
