# Episode 35: Finding Nemo & Kids Who Can't Focus

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss strategies for supporting children who struggle to focus, in the context of the film "Finding Nemo." They explore ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), which affects approximately 7% of children in Australia, and explain the concept of executive function through its three key components: working memory, mental flexibility, and impulse control. Billy emphasizes that ADHD is not related to intelligence and is often missed in girls who may be less hyperactive. The discussion highlights how social relationships are often more impacted than academic performance, and provides practical approaches for developing executive function skills in all children.

## Supporting Children Who Struggle to Focus Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Executive Function
- Executive function is our brain's "air traffic control system" with three main components: working memory, mental flexibility, and impulse control
- These skills begin developing in the first year of life, not just when children reach school age
- Executive function skills are stronger predictors of school success than academic skills like reading or knowing the alphabet
- ADHD is characterized by difficulties with executive function, not lack of intelligence
- Girls often present with more inattentive symptoms rather than hyperactivity, causing many to be overlooked until later in schooling

### 2. Developing Working Memory Skills
- Break multi-step instructions down into individual steps rather than giving complex directions
- For morning routines, start with one step ("get your school bag") before adding additional steps
- Practice memory games appropriate to your child's level (e.g., hiding objects under cloths for toddlers)
- Gradually increase the complexity as they master each level (e.g., from remembering 2 steps to 3 steps)
- Create visual aids or checklists for routines to reduce the memory burden while building skills

### 3. Building Mental Flexibility
- Teach children to adjust to changing circumstances (e.g., "It's raining, so we need gumboots instead of regular shoes")
- Practice rule-switching in games (e.g., sorting by color, then changing to sort by shape)
- Point out when rules or situations change and verbalize the adjustment needed
- Celebrate when your child shows flexibility in thinking or adapting to changes
- Model flexibility yourself by talking through your own adjustments to changing circumstances

### 4. Strengthening Impulse Control
- Practice in controlled, predictable environments before testing skills in challenging situations
- Role play scenarios requiring impulse control (like not chasing a ball onto the road)
- Give specific praise when children wait their turn or resist impulses
- Create subtle cues (like a gentle shoulder touch) to redirect focus without embarrassing the child
- The "sharks" in Finding Nemo demonstrate this struggle with their "Fish are friends, not food" mantra

### 5. Creating Supportive Learning Environments
- Reduce distractions when your child needs to focus (like turning off TV during homework)
- Gradually build tolerance to distractions rather than requiring perfect focus immediately
- Consider classroom positioning based on individual needs (some children focus better at the front, others at the back where they can see everything)
- Give specific, achievable tasks rather than vague instructions like "get ready"
- Focus on one skill at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once

### 6. Understanding ADHD Treatment
- Behavioral therapy and skill development should always be the first approach
- Medication should be considered after approximately 6 months of evidence-based intervention if issues persist
- Medication works quickly but has side effects including sleep difficulties and reduced appetite
- Poor sleep can worsen ADHD symptoms, creating a challenging cycle
- As children develop better executive function skills, many can reduce or eliminate medication
- Many teens recognize the benefits of medication for their relationships and work despite wishing they didn't need it
