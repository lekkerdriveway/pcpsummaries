## Screen Time Management Cheat Sheet

### 1. Content Selection Matters
- Content with purposeful story arcs and natural endpoints is better than endless scrolling formats
- Shows like Bluey intentionally model positive parent-child engagement that continues after viewing
- High-stimulation content with bright flashing elements can lead to regulation issues when turned off
- Watch content with your children when possible and discuss the messages being presented
- Monitor how different shows affect your child's behavior afterwards and adjust accordingly

### 2. Transitioning Off Screens
- Flag the approaching end time: "You have 5 minutes left" rather than abruptly turning it off
- Reframe language positively: "Show me how well you can turn it off" instead of "Time's up"
- Set children up for success by involving them in setting time limits: "How about we watch for 60 minutes?"
- Celebrate successful transitions: "You did such a good job turning it off when asked!"
- Have an engaging alternative activity ready for when screen time ends

### 3. Social vs. Passive Screen Use
- Distinguish between active screen use (social gaming, creating content) and passive consumption
- Online social connections can be valuable, especially for children who struggle socially in person
- For children using screens socially, ensure in-person meetups still happen when possible
- Recognize when online communities provide important social development opportunities
- Talk with children about their online social experiences to stay connected with this part of their life

### 4. Managing Screen Boundaries With Secondary Caregivers
- Begin conversations with appreciation: "The kids love spending time with you"
- Focus on what you want more of rather than what you want less of: "They learn so much when you share your experiences with them"
- Appeal to the unique value grandparents provide that screens can't: "They miss the chance to hear your stories when they're just watching TV"
- Be specific about what activities you'd love to see more of: "They talk about your gardening all week"
- Accept some flexibility in rules at grandparents' homes while maintaining core boundaries

### 5. Screen Time Structure and Limits
- Consider using traditional TV channels sometimes as they have natural endpoints to programs
- Understand that streaming and on-demand services are designed to keep viewers engaged indefinitely
- Help children develop patience by not always providing immediate content gratification
- For young children (3-4 years), recognize they developmentally struggle with delayed gratification
- Set consistent, clear boundaries while acknowledging that occasionally rules may differ in different environments

### 6. Screens for Regulation and Rest
- Recognize that some children, especially those with neurodevelopmental differences, may use screens to regulate
- If screen time helps your child calm down after school/therapy, don't feel guilty about strategic use
- Consider what format works best for your child (some may do better with less interactive options)
- Look for natural stopping points in content rather than endless streaming
- Balance screen regulation time with other coping strategies and gradually build alternatives
