## Breaking Parenting Cycles Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding and Prioritizing Wellbeing
- Ruthlessly prioritize what matters most in your family life—cut out non-essentials
- Quality of interactions with children matters more than quantity of time spent together
- Create protected daily "sanctuary" time for moments of joy and connection
- Remember the elements of PERMA: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment
- Accept that maintaining balance is an ongoing effort—sometimes plates will fall

### 2. Finding Meaning and Breaking Negative Patterns
- Meaning develops in three stages: embedding in a culture, internalizing values, then contributing to community
- Help children find ways to contribute meaningfully at school and home to develop their sense of purpose
- Consider which negative cycles to break first: either choose "easy wins" to build momentum or tackle the most disruptive issue
- For persistent problems, try a time-limited "experiment" rather than demanding permanent change
- Support children transitioning to new environments (like school) by helping them find their meaningful place

### 3. Supporting Relationships and Connection
- When someone is negative or resistant to change, focus first on understanding their perspective rather than demanding change
- Ask genuine, curious questions instead of making accusations or demands
- Find the "hook" for change—identify what would motivate the other person to want things to be different
- With "old school" parents, build connection first before suggesting different approaches
- Remember that modeling healthy relationships with your partner teaches children what to expect in their future relationships

### 4. Managing Stress and Engaging Positively
- Parents of children with additional needs must prioritize self-care to sustain their caregiving
- Notice when stress manifests as increased screen scrolling or other avoidance behaviors
- Replace mindless scrolling with activities that create flow—where challenge meets skill level
- When feeling overwhelmed by children's mess or lack of contribution, consider what matters most long-term
- For co-regulation (supporting children's emotional regulation), recognize that while initially exhausting, it prevents longer-term struggles

### 5. Finding Balance Across Life Stages
- As children grow, particularly into teenage years, they seek meaning and relationships outside the family
- Gaming can provide immersion but rarely true "flow"—look for activities that consistently stretch abilities
- Acknowledge when work or other areas that previously provided meaning no longer do so, and seek new sources
- Be conscious of the language used with children—catch yourself before saying things like "after all I do for you"
- Remember that we all have areas of PERMA that come naturally and others that require more effort—identify your strengths and challenges
