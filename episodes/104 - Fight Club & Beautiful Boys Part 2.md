## Raising Boys Cheat Sheet

### 1. Supporting Emotional Expression
- Normalize boys crying - model emotional expression as fathers and caregivers
- Acknowledge that while 99% of PCP listeners believe it's okay for men to cry, mainstream culture often still reinforces "boys don't cry" messaging
- Teach that all emotions are valid, not just anger or excitement
- Point out when boys are showing care and empathy (like Billy praising his daughter for comforting her brother)
- Recognize when boys are experiencing emotions but struggling to express them verbally
- Create regular opportunities for boys to practice identifying and talking about feelings

### 2. Teaching Healthy Conflict Resolution
- Model how to stand up for yourself without resorting to aggression (like Billy's example of responding calmly to the truck driver)
- Establish clear boundaries: "Nobody can hit you, and you cannot hit anybody"
- When addressing physical aggression, follow this sequence: connect first, help calm, then correct
- Avoid shaming boys for aggression while still maintaining firm boundaries
- Teach boys to recognize when they're becoming dysregulated and practice calming strategies
- Show boys that assertiveness doesn't require anger or physical force

### 3. Broadening Experiences and Relationships
- Actively expose boys to relationships with people different from themselves (different genders, cultures, orientations)
- Challenge the "in-group/out-group" mentality that patriarchal systems create
- Encourage friendships with girls and interactions with diverse peer groups
- Attend events that celebrate diverse expressions of masculinity and interests
- Point out positive male role models who challenge traditional masculine stereotypes
- Remember that understanding different perspectives starts with relationship

### 4. Balancing Sports with Creative Expression
- Recognize that some sports environments can perpetuate toxic masculinity
- Choose sports programs and coaches who emphasize teamwork, respect, and emotional control
- Actively introduce boys to arts, music and creative pursuits alongside athletic activities
- Connect creative activities to boys' existing interests as an entry point
- Model engagement with creative activities yourself
- Celebrate when boys show interest in activities beyond stereotypical "boy things"
- Look for opportunities to practice care and nurturing (like Billy working with his son on playing with dolls)

### 5. Challenging Gender Stereotypes Thoughtfully
- Acknowledge your own discomfort with challenging gender norms while still supporting your child's expression
- Focus on building your child's self-esteem rather than forcing conformity for social acceptance
- When concerned about bullying, work with schools to change the culture rather than changing your child
- Discuss gender stereotypes openly and developmentally appropriately
- Recognize that girls often have more freedom to cross gender boundaries than boys do
- Teach critical thinking skills so children can question social messages about gender
- Remember that authentic self-expression builds stronger mental health in the long run
