## Breaking Bad Habits & Building Good Ones Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding How Habits Form
- Habits form through a cycle of cue → behavior → reward
- Childhood is where many lifelong habits are established
- Two key mechanisms for habit formation are repetition and imitation
- Habits become automatic over time, requiring minimal motivation or willpower
- Habit formation takes time—at least 2 weeks, up to 10 months for complex behaviors

### 2. Identifying Habit Triggers
- External cues are environmental signals (walking in the door after school)
- Internal cues are feelings or sensations (feeling angry or stressed)
- Identify what triggers unwanted behaviors in your child
- Watch for patterns in when problematic behaviors occur
- Catch triggers early, before the unwanted behavior is fully activated

### 3. Breaking Bad Habits
- Don't just focus on eliminating the bad habit—replace it with a positive one
- Change the environment to remove or modify the cue that triggers the behavior
- Create "choice architecture"—make healthy options more accessible than unhealthy ones
- Offer limited, appropriate choices to give children agency while guiding behavior
- Focus 95% of your energy on rewarding good behaviors rather than punishing bad ones

### 4. Building Good Habits Through Repetition
- Start with small, achievable steps (like touching each tooth with the toothbrush)
- Create a consistent routine with clear cues (same time, same place, same sequence)
- Use positive narratives that connect with your child's interests ("strong teeth like Bluey")
- Reward immediate progress rather than focusing only on long-term goals
- Be patient—habits take consistent repetition over weeks or months to establish

### 5. The Power of Imitation
- Children naturally imitate their parents' behaviors and coping mechanisms
- Model the habits you want your children to develop
- Let children see you practicing good habits (even from an early age)
- Involve children in your routines before expecting them to perform them independently
- Help children develop a positive identity around healthy habits ("we're a family that...")

### 6. Practical Examples
- **For tooth brushing:** Sandwich it between pleasant activities, make it part of a consistent bedtime routine
- **For reducing screen time:** Identify when screens are requested, offer 5 alternative activities to choose from
- **For healthy eating:** Make nutritious options visible and easily accessible
- **For managing anger:** Create alternative coping strategies that provide similar emotional relief
- **For any habit:** Connect the desired behavior to your child's own goals and interests

### 7. A Developmental Approach
- Match expectations to your child's developmental abilities
- As children get older, give them more input into which habits to cultivate
- Help children understand the "why" behind important habits
- Focus on habits that build autonomy and competence
- Remember that your goal is to help them develop self-regulation, not just compliance
