## Managing Big Feelings Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Your Role as a Parent First
- Work on your own emotional regulation before trying to teach your children
- Recognize that 77% of parents weren't allowed to have big feelings as children
- Use the "situation, attention, appraisal, behavior" framework to identify where you need improvement
- Focus on specific situations (e.g., "mornings with kids") rather than general goals ("get better at self-regulation")
- Remember that repairing after emotional outbursts is critical for your relationship with your child

### 2. Practical Strategies for Parents
- Use physical signals like soft earplugs that reduce noise but still allow you to hear your children
- Remove yourself from the situation when overwhelmed: "I'm going to leave the room and come back when I'm calm"
- Practice mindfulness techniques daily to build capacity for emotional moments
- Maintain protective factors (exercise, sleep, support) to increase your emotional capacity
- Prepare mentally before entering potentially triggering situations (car trips, public outings)

### 3. Supporting Children Through Emotional Moments
- Validate feelings before attempting to solve problems: "I'm sorry you feel so angry, it must be hard"
- Approach children at their level physically (get down to eye level) when they're upset
- Recognize that stress responses like bed-wetting during emotional outbursts are normal and not cause for shame
- Focus on connection and creating safe space rather than immediately correcting behavior
- Celebrate when children return for comfort after emotional outbursts—it shows secure attachment

### 4. Special Considerations for Different Needs
- For children with ADHD: understand they may go "0-100" quickly (like "Ferraris") and need help with impulse control
- Start teaching emotional regulation in safe environments with small challenges before tackling difficult situations
- For neurodivergent parents: identify and use tools (like noise-reducing earplugs) that help you stay regulated
- Recognize that strong emotional responses between parent and child are biologically wired—it's normal to feel intensely
- Adapt strategies based on your child's specific needs and developmental stage

### 5. Handling Public Emotional Moments
- Know that removing your child from overwhelming situations is often the best first step
- Prepare simple responses to unhelpful comments from strangers
- Look for compassionate stories about judgmental strangers ("they must be having a hard day")
- Find allies who can offer support ("Are you okay?") rather than judgment 
- Remember that repair can happen even after difficult public moments—the car moment described showed beautiful repair
