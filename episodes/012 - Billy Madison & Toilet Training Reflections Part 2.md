# Episode 12: Billy Madison & Toilet Training Reflections

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss toilet training challenges and setbacks, in the context of the film "Billy Madison." As a reflective practice episode following their previous toilet training discussion, they respond to listener questions about common concerns including whether parents can "ruin their child's life" by getting toilet training wrong, the effectiveness of the "10pm sleepy wee," and managing regression when new siblings arrive. Billy emphasizes that toilet training setbacks are normal and explains how constipation can create a vicious cycle of avoidance, while Nick shares personal experiences of what worked with his children's nighttime training.

## Toilet Training Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

### 1. Managing Setbacks and Pressure
- Setbacks are completely normal and won't harm your child's long-term development
- The worst thing you can do when learning a new skill is add pressure and stress
- When facing regression, "hit pause" on your toilet training plan rather than pushing harder
- Remove expectations temporarily when you notice things getting worse
- Remember that recovery is more important than avoiding mistakes—both for kids and parents

### 2. Navigating Major Life Changes
- Regression commonly occurs with big changes like a new sibling arriving
- Children aged 2-3 are naturally egocentric and often struggle with sharing parental attention
- Toilet training is often about autonomy and control; children may regress as a way to regain control
- Be especially patient during transitions to new environments (daycare, kindergarten)
- Recognize that toilet anxiety in unfamiliar settings (like kindergarten) is very common

### 3. Handling Nighttime Dryness
- Daytime and nighttime dryness are separate skills that often develop at different times
- 10-15% of children in early primary school still wet the bed at least once a week
- Instead of the "sleepy wee" (waking children to use the toilet), try:
  - Limiting fluid intake 1-2 hours before bedtime
  - Making regular toilet trips part of the bedtime routine
  - Using night nappies/pull-ups until you notice they're consistently dry in the morning
- When transitioning from night nappies, go cold turkey after 1-2 weeks of consistent dryness

### 4. Addressing Constipation Issues
- Watch for signs of constipation, as many children "hold" when anxious about toileting
- Holding creates a vicious cycle: anxiety → holding → constipation → pain → more anxiety
- "Encopresis" refers to constipation where liquid stool leaks around hard blockages (may appear like diarrhea)
- Ensure adequate water and fiber intake as preventative measures
- Consult your doctor for persistent constipation issues

### 5. Creating Positive Toilet Learning
- Never use shame or punishment for accidents ("Mate, I can't believe you've done this")
- Include children in the clean-up process after accidents in a non-judgmental way
- Use positive narration: "You're growing up so quick. Do you think we could try staying dry overnight?"
- Consider reward systems (stickers, small tokens) to reinforce successes, but keep them low-pressure
- Be willing to take a complete break from toilet training if it becomes a source of family stress
