## Nurturing Sibling Relationships Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding the Impact of a New Sibling
- An identity crisis often occurs when a new baby arrives ("Who am I in the world now?")
- Children may respond by ignoring, regressing to baby-like behavior, or becoming overly caregiving
- Remember that the primary relationship is still between parent and each child
- Protect and maintain individual relationships with each child through one-on-one time
- Never blame the new baby for family constraints ("We can't go to the park because of the baby")

### 2. Supporting Developmental Stages of Sibling Relationships
- Stage 1: Initial acknowledgment of the sibling's existence
- Stage 2: Seeing the sibling as an "object" (similar to a doll)
- Stage 3: Relationship focused around shared activities or play
- Stage 4: Recognizing the sibling as an equal person with feelings
- Match your expectations to your child's developmental stage
- Don't ask young children to "think about their sibling's feelings" before they're developmentally able

### 3. Scaffolding Successful Interactions
- Predict times of potential conflict and prepare in advance
- Provide the level of support needed for interactions to succeed
- Intervene before conflicts escalate (Plan A) but accept when separation is needed (Plan B)
- Look for moments when siblings are successfully interacting and reinforce these
- Evaluate what you could adjust rather than expecting children to change
- Create consistent systems for sharing desired items (like special placemats)

### 4. Handling Conflict Constructively
- Don't leave children to "sort it out themselves" as this often means physical strength wins
- Avoid creating competition for parental approval during conflicts
- Skills development happens when children are calm, not in the midst of conflict
- Use conflicts as opportunities to teach lifelong relationship skills
- Remember that siblings without proper scaffolding might develop worse conflict resolution skills

### 5. Building Long-term Bonds
- Foster a sense that siblings see themselves in each other
- Create narratives highlighting shared strengths and similarities
- Avoid preferential treatment which can create lasting competitive relationships
- Don't push older children into inappropriate caregiving roles
- Maintain equity in how you engage with each child
- Remember the goal is "bonded" relationships, not distant, hostile or competitive ones
- Allow children autonomy to choose the relationship rather than forcing it
