## School Success Cheat Sheet

### 1. Preventing Academic Pressure & Burnout
- Watch your child for signs of stress and establish clear communication pathways before problems arise
- Focus conversations on effort and process rather than outcomes and achievements
- Validate feelings around failure and disappointment without immediately jumping to fix them
- Help children identify what aspects of school they enjoy, not just what they struggle with
- Recognize that every child should find something positive about their school experience

### 2. Building Relationships with Teachers
- Prioritize establishing trust between your child and their teacher early in the year
- Help your child see the teacher as a person with interests and a life outside school
- Find common ground with teachers even when you have different approaches
- Share specific information about what strategies work at home for consistency
- When you don't "gel" with a teacher, focus on identifying shared goals for your child

### 3. Supporting Children's Learning
- Praise specific efforts in real-time rather than general outcomes after the fact
- Use language like "I can see how hard you're trying to..." instead of just "good job"
- When children struggle academically, identify the specific learning hurdle rather than assuming more practice alone will help
- For homework, focus on understanding processes rather than repetitive practice
- Remember that research doesn't support homework as universally beneficial, especially for younger children

### 4. Navigating Social Challenges
- When children have conflicts, use it as an opportunity to model conflict resolution
- Show your reasoning process transparently rather than just imposing solutions
- For children struggling socially, identify specifically what aspect they find difficult (turn-taking, reading nonverbal cues, etc.)
- When addressing problematic behavior (like exclusion), focus on understanding why it's happening and teaching skills
- Help children understand consequences (not punishments) of their social choices

### 5. Managing School Transitions
- For children starting school, focus on building their emotional regulation skills and relationships
- For autistic or sensitive children, identify specific vulnerabilities (sensory, transitions, social) and prioritize supporting those areas
- When considering school changes, always address underlying issues rather than expecting a new environment alone to solve problems
- For school readiness, focus on developmental ability rather than just age
- Remember that holding children back should be purposeful with specific developmental goals, not just giving "more time"

### 6. Building Resilience When Things Go Wrong
- When children make mistakes at school (stealing, acting out), approach with curiosity about why it happened
- Stand beside children to help them improve rather than punishing or shaming them
- Help children who need to always be "right" by gradually increasing their tolerance for feedback
- Recognize that showing your own process of learning from mistakes is powerful modeling
- Remember that a child's repeated behavioral issues might signal that adults need to change their approach
