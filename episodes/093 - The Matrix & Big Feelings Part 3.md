# Episode 93: Big Feelings Part 3

## Episode Summary
In this episode, Billy and Nick discuss strategies for managing children's emotional outbursts, specifically focusing on more intense situations involving physical aggression and big emotional displays. This third installment on big feelings addresses listener questions about handling children's tantrums in public, managing parental shame, supporting toddlers with language delays who can't express their emotions verbally, and how parents can model appropriate emotional expression. The episode features several powerful listener stories including parents successfully supporting children through school project stress, siblings helping each other regulate emotions, and a parent breaking generational cycles of emotional suppression. Billy and Nick emphasize the importance of connection before correction when children experience overwhelming feelings.

## Handling Big Feelings Cheat Sheet

### 1. Responding to Emotional Outbursts
- Focus first on connection, then help calm, then correct behavior
- Avoid saying "use your words" when a child is flooded with emotion
- Acknowledge and validate feelings: "I can see you're disappointed" rather than "it's okay"
- Allow children to express that things are unfair or difficult
- Remember that repair after mistakes is more important than perfect responses

### 2. Managing Public Meltdowns
- Focus on supporting your child rather than worrying about others' judgment
- Remember that most parents understand and have been there themselves
- Offer practical help to other parents struggling with children's emotions (e.g., "Can I help?")
- Accept that public meltdowns are normal developmental experiences, not parenting failures
- Prioritize connection with your child over managing others' perceptions

### 3. Supporting Children with Language Delays
- Recognize that 15% of 2-year-olds have expressive language delays
- Focus on interpreting and responding to non-verbal communication (body language, facial expressions)
- Avoid forcing children to "use words" when they're emotionally flooded
- Make communication successful by responding to whatever form of expression they use
- Set low expectations for verbal expression during emotional moments

### 4. Teaching Emotional Awareness
- Begin discussing emotions from infancy through narration
- Use stories, play and daily interactions to introduce emotional vocabulary
- Name both positive and negative emotions (joy, sadness, anger, excitement)
- Acknowledge that toddlers (around age 2) begin developing more complex emotions like shame, guilt, and empathy
- Include emotional awareness naturally in play rather than formal lessons

### 5. Modeling Your Own Emotions
- Let children see you having appropriate emotional responses
- Narrate your own feelings: "I'm feeling frustrated right now"
- Demonstrate healthy ways to manage emotions
- Be transparent when you make mistakes: "I'm sorry I got angry, that wasn't fair to you"
- Show that all emotions are acceptable, while not all behaviors are acceptable

### 6. Breaking Generational Patterns
- Recognize that many parents grew up in homes where emotions were suppressed
- Set realistic expectations for yourself as you learn new skills
- Remember that imperfect modeling with repair teaches more than perfect responses
- Seek support (like therapy) to develop emotional awareness if you struggle with it
- Focus on progress rather than perfection in emotional expression

### 7. Managing Multiple Children's Emotions
- Build emotional skills in one-on-one settings before expecting success in group situations
- Have low expectations for managing multiple children's big feelings simultaneously
- Consider physically separating children when emotions are escalating between them
- Acknowledge that some days are about survival rather than perfect responses
- Model emotional regulation by acknowledging your own feelings when overwhelmed
