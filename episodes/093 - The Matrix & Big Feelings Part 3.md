## Managing Children's Big Feelings Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding What "Big Feelings" Really Are
- Big feelings occur when we lose 100% control of our emotional responses
- This includes positive emotions (excitement, joy) not just negative ones
- Children start developing reflective feelings like empathy, shame, and guilt in their 2nd-3rd year
- Recognize that all feelings are part of being human - the goal isn't to eliminate them but manage them
- Validate that it's normal and okay to have intense emotions

### 2. Responding When Your Child Has a Meltdown
- Connect first before trying to teach or correct
- Hold space for feelings without rushing to fix them: "It's actually not OK because I can see how disappointed you are"
- Allow children to experience feelings fully before moving to problem-solving
- Focus on validating emotions rather than minimizing with phrases like "it's OK" or "it doesn't matter"
- Remember the sequence: connect, calm, then correct

### 3. Modeling Healthy Expression of Your Own Emotions
- Children learn emotional regulation by watching adults, even from infancy
- Name your feelings out loud: "I'm feeling frustrated right now"
- Explain when you're having a hard time: "This isn't your fault. I'm feeling angry and I need a moment"
- Show how you repair after emotional mistakes: "I'm sorry I spoke harshly. I was feeling overwhelmed"
- Don't hide all negative emotions - children need to see appropriate ways to express them

### 4. Supporting Children with Language Limitations
- For toddlers or children with language delays (approximately 15% of 2-year-olds), focus on non-verbal communication
- Respond to body posture, facial expressions, and gestures rather than requiring verbal expression
- Don't force children to "use their words" when they're emotionally flooded
- Make them feel successful with whatever communication method they can manage
- Remember that communication is much more than speaking

### 5. Teaching About Emotions Through Play and Stories
- Start teaching about emotions very early - even before age 2
- Use storytelling and imaginative play to explore emotional experiences
- Label all emotions in daily life - not just negative ones
- Talk about body sensations that accompany different feelings
- Create opportunities to practice emotional skills during calm moments, not just during crises

### 6. When You're Struggling With Your Own Emotions
- Lower your expectations on difficult days
- Focus on safety and basic needs when your own emotional resources are depleted 
- It's okay to separate children who are triggering each other's big feelings
- Take breaks when needed: "I need a moment to calm down so I can help you better"
- Repair relationship ruptures: acknowledge when your reactions weren't helpful and reconnect

### 7. Managing Public Meltdowns
- Remember that your role is to support your child, not manage others' perceptions
- Focus on your child's needs rather than feeling shame about public judgment
- Offer assistance to other parents dealing with meltdowns: "Can I help you with that?"
- Express empathy rather than judgment or quick fixes
- Remember that most parents understand and have been in similar situations
