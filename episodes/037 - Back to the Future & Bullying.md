# Episode 37: Back to the Future & Bullying

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss childhood bullying and effective approaches to addressing it, in the context of the film "Back to the Future." They critique the film's simplistic portrayal of dealing with bullies through violence, where George McFly resolves his bullying problem by punching Biff in the face. Billy explains how bullying affects 25-40% of children, with about 10-15% experiencing chronic bullying lasting more than six months. They discuss how bullying can cause lasting trauma and lead to serious mental health issues, and emphasize that responsibility for stopping bullying should never be placed solely on the child being targeted.

## Understanding and Addressing Bullying Cheat Sheet

### 1. Recognizing Bullying
- Bullying involves a power imbalance between the bully and victim
- It affects 25-40% of children, with 10-15% experiencing chronic bullying
- Bullying is a form of trauma that can have lifelong impacts on mental health
- Two types of bullies: "alpha" (maintaining power/social status) and "delta" (often have experienced bullying or have underlying issues)
- Bullying can be physical, verbal, relational (social exclusion), or cyber-based

### 2. Proactive Conversations with Children
- Have conversations about bullying before it happens, not after
- Discuss what bullying looks like and why it's unacceptable
- Use examples from movies or TV shows to identify bullying behaviors
- Create open dialogue so kids feel comfortable coming to you if they experience bullying
- Talk about what to do if they witness bullying, not just if they're the target
- Let children know it's never their fault if they're bullied

### 3. Modeling Appropriate Behavior
- Children learn more from what they see than what they hear
- Be mindful of how you treat service workers, talk about others when they're not present
- Avoid gossip in front of children as it models social exclusion
- Demonstrate respectful conflict resolution in your own relationships
- Show empathy toward others, especially those who are different
- If you make a mistake, model appropriate repair and apologizing

### 4. Responding to a Child Being Bullied
- Listen and validate their experience without minimizing it
- Let the child decide how serious the bullying is, don't dismiss their feelings
- Never place sole responsibility on the child to solve the problem
- Avoid advice like "just ignore it" or "punch them back"

- Focus on building the child's self-esteem and social connections
- Assure them it's not their fault and they don't deserve this treatment

### 5. Working with Schools on Bullying Issues

- Effective programs focus on whole-school approaches, not just the individuals involved
- Partner with teachers to create consistent responses to bullying
- Know your school's anti-bullying policy and reporting procedures
- Follow up regularly if your child is being bullied
- If a school isn't responsive, document incidents and escalate as needed
- Talk to your child about positive bystander behaviors they can model

### 6. Handling Social Media and Cyberbullying
- Cyberbullying increased during the pandemic while traditional bullying decreased
