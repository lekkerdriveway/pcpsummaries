## Building Secure Attachment Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Attachment Fundamentals
- Attachment is the emotional bond between a child and caregiver that provides security and shapes future relationships
- Secure attachment is characterized by children who feel confident in relationships and use parents as a "safe haven"
- Attachment issues don't mean you've "failed" - they can always be repaired and improved
- Your child's temperament (particularly sensitivity) significantly impacts how much effort attachment requires
- Even if you had insecure attachment as a child, you can break the cycle with awareness and intentional parenting

### 2. Signs of Secure vs. Insecure Attachment
- Secure attachment: Child seeks comfort when distressed, explores confidently, and gives honest feedback
- Insecure-avoidant: Child withdraws, appears self-sufficient, and avoids vulnerability in relationships
- Insecure-ambivalent: Child shows clingy behavior, excessive need for reassurance, and anxiety about connection
- A child who can safely express negative feelings to you demonstrates secure attachment
- For teenagers: Seeking you out as a "sanctuary" and exploring independently with confidence indicates secure attachment

### 3. Responding to Children's Distress
- Physical connection and non-verbal communication are as important as what you say
- Get down to the child's level physically to establish connection
- Use simple reassuring phrases like "I'm here" and "You're safe"
- Responding to distress builds security (ignoring it teaches children they can't count on you)
- When a child is highly anxious (like Natalie Portman's character in Heat), prioritize connection over other tasks
- Remember that stopping crying isn't always the goal - sometimes children express distress while feeling securely attached

### 4. Building Attachment in Daily Life
- Lower your standards for household perfection when building relationships is more important
- Prioritize genuine interest and delight in your child over performance or achievement
- Create consistent routines that provide security (like the "hot lap" scooter ritual described)
- Model co-regulation by demonstrating calm breathing and emotional management
- Remember attachment is built through millions of small interactions, not grand gestures

### 5. Supporting Children with Attachment Challenges
- Teachers and other caring adults can provide significant attachment relationships for vulnerable children
- When working with children from difficult backgrounds, focus on building trust before addressing behavior
- For children who have witnessed violence or trauma, understand that defensive behaviors are protective strategies
- Show genuine interest in the child's world and activities to build connection
- Be patient - attachment takes time to build, especially with children who have experienced relationship disruptions
