## Supporting Children with Depression Cheat Sheet

### 1. Recognizing Depression in Children
- Look for persistent changes in behavior lasting more than two weeks
- Signs may include loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (not riding bikes, not engaging socially)
- Depression can manifest as anger or irritability rather than just sadness, especially in children
- Pay attention to changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels
- Watch for statements about life not being worth living, which indicate serious risk
- Depression may surface during major transitions or stressful periods (like lockdowns)

### 2. Understanding Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- CBT addresses both thinking patterns (cognitive) and behaviors that contribute to depression
- Help children identify unhelpful thought patterns like catastrophizing ("one thing goes wrong, everything will go wrong")
- Practice cognitive restructuring by gently challenging negative assumptions ("Maybe your friend isn't mad, maybe they're just busy")
- Replace negative thinking with alternative perspectives rather than simply saying "stop thinking that way"
- Set achievable, goal-oriented behavior changes that provide purpose and motivation
- Tailor strategies to the individual child—what works for one may not work for another

### 3. Environmental Modifications & Behavior Changes
- Consider changing aspects of your child's environment if they're around peers who aren't supportive
- Help develop separate social groups through extracurricular activities if school relationships are challenging
- Identify specific behaviors that help improve mood (exercise, reading, social connection) and those that worsen it
- Create structure around protective activities—schedule them rather than waiting until you "feel like it"
- Maintain consistent routines for sleep, physical activity, and social connection
- For previously depressed children who are now doing well, continue protective activities at a maintenance level

### 4. Medication Considerations
- Not all children with depression need medication—it's typically introduced for moderate to severe cases
- The best evidence supports combining medication with therapy rather than medication alone
- Medication may be started first if a child is unable to engage in therapy due to severe symptoms
- Unlike ADHD medications, depression medications take weeks to show benefits and require finding the right dose
- After significant improvement period (months), medication can be gradually reduced with close monitoring
- Remember: "Pills don't teach skills"—medication creates capacity for learning coping strategies

### 5. Supporting Reluctant Children
- Avoid pressuring children to get help as this often pushes them in the opposite direction
- Find their "Falcor" (source of hope)—what matters to them or once brought them joy
- Take gentle approaches: "Why don't we just cruise down to the club and see what's going on?" rather than "You need to get back to training three times a week"
- Model healthy help-seeking behavior by being open about your own mental health care
- Demonstrate that getting help is normal and doesn't mean something is "wrong" with you
- For parents with their own mental health struggles: prioritize your own care to better support your child

### 6. Prevention Strategies
- Build a foundation of open communication about emotions before problems arise
- Help children develop skills to recognize and name their feelings
- Create an environment where mental health is discussed as normally as physical health
- Teach children it's not their fault when they experience emotional struggles
- Be aware of your child's specific vulnerabilities and early warning signs based on past experiences
- When a child has previously experienced depression, maintain awareness of potential triggers
