## Parenting Styles Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding the Four Parenting Styles
- Authoritarian: High demand, low warmth - "I'm the law, you do it because I say so"
- Permissive: Low demand, high warmth - "I just want you to like me"
- Neglectful: Low demand, low warmth - Not present emotionally or physically
- Authoritative: High demand, high warmth - "You have a voice and I share power appropriately for your age"
- Aim for authoritative parenting, which balances connection with appropriate boundaries

### 2. Applying Parenting Styles Across Ages
- For babies: Give autonomy by responding to their cues and mirroring their expressions
- Be fully present during routine tasks (like diaper changes) to maintain connection
- For toddlers: Use clear boundaries for safety but explain reasons beyond "because I said so"
- For teenagers: Create partnership rather than battle - negotiate and problem-solve together
- Remember that all parents naturally vary their style based on circumstances and children's needs

### 3. Flexibility in Parenting Approaches
- It's appropriate to flex into different styles depending on the situation
- Sometimes permissive approaches are needed when a child is struggling emotionally
- High demand without warmth can damage self-esteem and connection
- Consistency between caregivers is most important when working on specific behaviors
- Success indicator: Do you and your child experience accomplishment most days?

### 4. Maintaining Connection While Setting Boundaries
- When children push boundaries, focus on relationship before correction
- With teens, find common ground and scaffold opportunities for positive connection
- Before expecting respect from children, demonstrate respect toward them
- Address challenging behaviors by understanding the underlying social or emotional needs
- Know when to temporarily set aside demands to prioritize warmth and connection

### 5. Breaking Generational Patterns
- Awareness of your own childhood experiences helps avoid repeating negative patterns
- When you hear your parents' voice coming through you, recognize it without self-judgment
- Developing reflective practice is the most significant predictor of effective parenting
- How you frame yourself as a parent strongly influences your actual parenting
- Trust your gut while remaining open to evidence-based approaches that align with your values

### 6. Managing Different Parenting Styles in the Family
- With grandparents or co-parents who have different styles, focus on specific collaborative goals
- Highlight the positive aspects each person brings to the relationship with the child
- For divorced parents with different approaches, try to align on key priorities
- Guide grandparents toward connection-focused activities rather than disciplinary roles
- Remember that consistency on important issues is more crucial than identical approaches

### 7. Supporting Children Through Developmental Stages

- If increased demands aren't working, try decreasing demands and increasing warmth
- Make sure children experience success every day in some aspect of their life
- Be open about your emotions while modeling healthy regulation
