## Co-Parenting Cheat Sheet

### 1. Navigating Different Parenting Styles
- Recognize that complementary parenting styles can be beneficial rather than problematic
- Identify and openly acknowledge what your co-parent does well, both privately and in front of the children
- Focus on how different strengths can work together rather than trying to make both parents parent identically
- Ensure neither parent is using destructive approaches (neglectful/laissez-faire or overly authoritarian)
- Be especially aligned on approaches when children are struggling with specific issues (sleep, anxiety, etc.)

### 2. Managing Parental Preference
- Understand that children often prefer one parent during certain developmental stages (especially under age 2)
- Recognize this as normal development rather than a reflection on parenting quality
- Validate the rejected parent's feelings of hurt while not trying to immediately "fix" the situation
- Create special one-on-one time for the less-preferred parent when children are calm and regulated
- Sometimes it's better for the preferred parent to remove themselves so children can build connections with others
- Remember that preferences often reverse or shift as children develop

### 3. Having Productive Co-Parenting Conversations
- Schedule dedicated time for important parenting discussions rather than addressing issues in the moment
- Begin with open questions: "How do you think our evenings are going?" rather than "We need more routine"
- Identify the "hook" or motivation that would make your partner interested in changing approaches
- Focus on positive outcomes: "More routine might give us more time together in the evenings"
- Take a proactive approach to potential challenges (like preparing for a second child) rather than waiting for crisis

### 4. Supporting Children Through Separation
- Create safe opportunities for children to express their feelings about the separation
- Consistently reinforce that the separation was not their fault
- Explain that relationships change but love for children remains constant
- Model healthy emotional expression rather than hiding feelings
- Balance caring for others with demonstrating self-care, especially for daughters who might become "people pleasers"
- Protect the children's relationship with both parents by speaking respectfully about your ex-partner

### 5. Role Modeling Co-Parenting Behaviors
- Demonstrate affection toward your partner in front of your children to model healthy relationships
- Show children how to navigate disagreements respectfully
- Be aware that children will often adopt your behaviors more than your stated values
- Consider how your actions are creating "blueprints" for your children's future relationships
- Balance independence with interdependence in the relationship
- Recognize that how you treat your co-parent teaches children about their own worth and how relationships work

### 6. Working with Grandparents as Co-Parents
- Set realistic expectations about routines when children are with grandparents
- Accept that "Vegas rules" (less structure, more treats) may apply during grandparent time
- Address boundaries respectfully, especially with in-laws where the relationship dynamic is different
- Recognize that grandparent interactions may trigger your own childhood experiences
- Appreciate the support while maintaining your role as the primary decision-maker for your children

### 7. Demonstrating Complementary Parenting
- Identify specific times of day or activities where each parent naturally excels
- Create division of labor that plays to each parent's strengths
- Actively reinforce your co-parent's positive interactions with children
- Discuss parenting approaches during calm moments, not in the midst of challenges
- Remember that children benefit from experiencing different approaches and perspectives
