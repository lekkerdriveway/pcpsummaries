## Supporting Fussy Eaters Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understand the Division of Responsibilities
- Parents are responsible for what food is offered, when it's offered, where it's offered, and the mealtime environment
- Children are responsible for how much they eat (if anything at all)
- Recognize that hunger is a powerful drive - trust that children will eat when they need to
- Avoid stepping into your child's responsibility zone by pressuring them to eat more or specific foods
- Remember that approximately 50% of parents report dealing with fussy eating at some point - you're not alone

### 2. Create a Positive Mealtime Environment
- Make family mealtimes a sanctuary and positive experience
- Use meals as opportunities for developing social skills, learning manners and having meaningful conversations
- Model enjoying a variety of foods yourself - children learn by watching what you eat
- Keep the atmosphere calm and pressure-free - avoid negotiations about food during the meal
- Turn off screens and make mealtime about connection
- Remember that positive experiences with food are protective for children's future relationship with eating

### 3. Implement Helpful Structure
- Establish consistent meal and snack times
- Always include at least one "safe food" on the plate that you know your child will eat
- Try the "4 things on a plate" approach - include options with varying nutrition levels
- Allow children to eat foods in any order they choose
- Don't use dessert or treats as rewards for eating other foods
- Recognize that structure and consistency help children develop skills around eating

### 4. Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Don't insist children clean their plate or eat everything served
- Avoid statements like "if you eat your vegetables, you can have dessert" which reinforces that vegetables are undesirable
- Don't create power struggles around food - these typically backfire
- Avoid labeling children as "fussy eaters" which can create a self-fulfilling identity
- Don't prepare separate meals for different family members (though having safe foods available is important)
- Be aware that using food as comfort or reward can establish unhealthy relationships with food that continue into adulthood

### 5. Support Skill Development
- Recognize that learning to eat a variety of foods is a skill that requires practice
- Expect children to need 10-15 exposures to a new food before accepting it
- Involve children in meal planning and preparation to increase interest
- Consider checking for constipation if a child is very fussy - there's often a connection
- Focus on small successes rather than perfect nutrition at every meal
- Be patient - the goal is long-term healthy eating habits, not winning each mealtime battle
