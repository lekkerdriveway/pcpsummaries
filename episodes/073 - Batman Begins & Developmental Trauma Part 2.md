## Understanding Developmental Trauma Cheat Sheet

### 1. Identifying Signs of Developmental Trauma
- Look for four main symptom categories: intrusive thoughts/nightmares, avoidance behaviors, increased negativity/self-blame, and hyperarousal/hostility
- Children themselves determine what experiences are traumatic—what traumatizes one child may not affect another
- Some traumatized children act out aggressively while others show "learned helplessness" and become withdrawn
- Trauma and clinical anxiety can present similarly, but trauma requires a specific threatening experience
- School refusal/avoidance may indicate past traumatic experiences in that environment

### 2. Creating Safety for Traumatized Children
- Safety must be the top priority—a child acting out is feeling the most unsafe in that environment
- Approach dysregulated children with calm, confident presence that communicates "you're safe because you're with me"
- For aggressive behaviors, recognize that the child is the one feeling least safe in that situation
- Avoid isolating children when they're struggling as this reinforces their sense of being unsafe
- Be flexible in your parenting approach, especially with sensitive children who've experienced trauma

### 3. Breaking Cycles of Generational Trauma
- Generational trauma is not destined to repeat—cycles can absolutely be broken
- Focus on recovery after difficult moments; it's the repair that matters most, not preventing all mistakes
- Model better ways of handling strong emotions (using calming techniques, taking space when needed)
- Seek professional help for your own trauma—increasing your capacity as a parent is essential
- Separate your own childhood experiences from your child's needs—they are a unique individual

### 4. Responding to Children's Exposure to Traumatic Events
- Create opportunities for children to share their distress rather than forcing conversations
- Ask about their understanding and feelings before providing information
- Be honest but emphasize safety and security where possible
- Limit overexposure to disturbing content and counterbalance with positive experiences
- Focus on the helpers and positive narratives within difficult situations
- For sensitive or empathetic children, be mindful that even seemingly benign media can be frightening

### 5. Supporting Recovery from Trauma
- Recovery from developmental trauma is absolutely possible with proper support
- Relationships can heal trauma—consistent, responsive caregiving builds safety and trust over time
- Identify the specific need your child is showing (emotional regulation, trust issues, etc.) and focus on that
- For children who experienced lockdown-related trauma, understand they may have adapted to a smaller, more predictable world
- Remember that sensitive temperaments paired with inflexible parenting is a significant risk factor
- Children with neurodevelopmental conditions (ADHD, autism, anxiety) can be more vulnerable to trauma impacts
