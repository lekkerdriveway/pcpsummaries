## Mental Health First Aid Cheat Sheet

### 1. Use the ALGEE Framework
- **A** - Approach, assess, and assist: Approach calmly, assess safety risk, assist without judgment
- **L** - Listen non-judgmentally: Use open-ended questions and avoid interrupting
- **G** - Give support: Reassure and provide information
- **E** - Encourage professional help seeking: Help connect them with appropriate support
- **E** - Encourage other supports: Suggest helpful strategies and coping mechanisms

### 2. Stay Calm During a Crisis
- Practice "interoception" - check in with your own physical sensations and emotions
- Focus on what you can control (like your breathing) when everything feels chaotic
- Use slow breaths to activate your calming nervous system
- Avoid rushing in with "fixing" energy when a child is dysregulated
- Partner with another adult if possible to help you maintain your composure

### 3. Respond Appropriately to Self-Harm
- Don't ignore or dismiss it, but avoid overreacting with shock or anger
- Attend to first aid needs calmly and matter-of-factly
- Avoid asking "why did you do this?" - instead ask "what's going on that's tough right now?"
- Understand self-harm serves different purposes: control, emotional release, stopping dissociation, or signaling for help
- Focus on addressing the underlying emotions rather than just stopping the behavior

### 4. Support Withdrawn or Avoidant Children
- Recognize avoidance as a coping strategy, not defiance or disinterest
- Play the "long game" - be consistent, responsive, gentle, and predictable
- Respect their need for space while maintaining availability
- Understand some children have learned that adults can't help them
- Don't pressure them to open up, but create safe opportunities for connection

### 5. Respond to Suicidal Thoughts
- Take all mentions of suicide seriously, even from younger children
- Stay with the child and ensure they're not left alone if at acute risk
- Don't use guilt or minimize their feelings (avoid phrases like "you have so much to live for")
- Explain that these feelings are symptoms of a treatable mental illness, not a personal failure
- With younger children, explore their understanding of death with open questions

### 6. Create Safety Plans with Children
- Develop plans with the child, not for them, to increase ownership
- Include specific coping strategies that have helped them in the past
- Identify trusted people they can reach out to when struggling
- Address harm minimization and ways to remove access to dangerous items
- Safety plans are more effective than "no harm" contracts

### 7. Build Emotional Understanding
- Teach whole classrooms/families about emotions and feelings so everyone has the same language
- Normalize experiencing difficult emotions rather than just focusing on happiness
- Model talking about your own feelings in developmentally appropriate ways
- Help children recognize the physical sensations that accompany different emotions
- Create a supportive community where emotional expression is accepted

### 8. Facilitate Genuine Connections
- Build partnerships with families by establishing trust first
- Find activities to do consistently with children (even virtually) that are purposeful and joyful
- Create spaces for casual conversations (like while playing) rather than formal check-ins
- Recognize that non-parental adults can be significant protective factors for vulnerable children
- Be authentic in your approach - children can sense when adults are genuinely interested

### 9. Take Care of Yourself After Providing Support
- Seek your own mental health first aid after helping someone else
- Debrief with a trusted colleague or friend
- Recognize the emotional toll of supporting someone in crisis
- Practice self-compassion - providing mental health first aid is challenging
- Know your own limits and when to bring in additional professional help
