## Supporting Children Who Can't Focus Cheat Sheet

### 1. Identifying ADHD vs. Typical Development
- Look for impact on function, not just behaviors (struggling in relationships, learning, daily activities)
- Challenges must appear in multiple environments (not just home or just school)
- Speak with teachers about specific behaviors you're noticing at home
- Remember that what appears as "developmental delay" can only be labeled as such retrospectively
- Consider whether challenges persist despite targeted skill development over 3-6 months

### 2. Explaining ADHD to Children
- First ask what they already know or think about ADHD
- Frame ADHD as having a "different kind of brain" that has both strengths and challenges
- Highlight positive aspects: creative thinking, noticing things others miss, energy, passion
- Explain that sometimes their brain works faster than most people's, which can make certain situations difficult
- Focus on making the challenging aspects smaller while celebrating the strengths
- Use language like: "Your brain thinks differently about things and catches stuff other people don't see"

### 3. Managing Emotional Aspects
- Recognize that ADHD isn't the cause of emotions (anger, anxiety, sadness) but affects how emotions are expressed
- Understand that impulsivity means children react immediately to emotions without processing
- Approximately 40% of children with ADHD also have anxiety—consider whether emotional difficulties need separate support
- Most children improve their emotional regulation over time with appropriate support
- Remember that behavioral problems peak at ages 3-4 for all children

### 4. Working with Schools and Co-Parents
- Establish consistent open communication with teachers (consider daily communication logs)
- Ensure consistent approaches between home and school environments
- Focus on one specific skill at a time rather than trying to address everything at once
- Accept that different parenting or teaching styles are beneficial, but consistency on specific goals is important
- When boundaries are inconsistent, children will naturally test them more frequently
- Share information resources like podcasts with skeptical family members or teachers

### 5. Building Executive Function Skills
- Identify which specific executive function needs support (working memory, cognitive flexibility, or impulse control)
- For transitions (a common struggle): provide more structure when moving between activities or environments
- Meet children at their developmental level, not their age or capabilities in other areas
- Build skills gradually in less demanding settings before expecting success in challenging environments
- For teens: focus on building trusting relationships and having open discussions about specific challenges
- Remember that executive function skills can improve at any age—it's never too late

### 6. Medication Considerations
- Medication increases neurotransmitters (dopamine and noradrenaline) in brain areas associated with executive function
- Effects vary: about 1/3 of children see small benefits, 1/3 moderate benefits, and 1/3 significant improvements
- "Pills don't teach skills"—medication should be combined with skill development
- Consider trying therapy first for younger children, but medication may be necessary if a child can't remain in school
- Trials of medication breaks (weekends/holidays) can help identify specific areas still needing support
- Sleep difficulties are common side effects—consider earlier dosing or sleep hygiene strategies

### 7. Addressing Stigma
- Share personal narratives and success stories of people with ADHD
- Provide education about ADHD being relatively common (affecting 7% of children)
- Emphasize that ADHD is not related to intelligence and doesn't limit future potential
- View neurodiversity as strengthening communities through different ways of thinking
- Remember that inclusion benefits everyone, not just the child with ADHD
- Use evidence-based information to counter misunderstandings

### 8. Classroom Strategies for Educators
- Recognize that transitions between activities or classrooms are particularly challenging
- Provide more scaffolding for organizational skills instead of expecting independence
- Understand that social environments (hallways, playgrounds) require different support than structured class time
- Accept that children may be at different developmental levels for different skills
- Build on strengths while providing targeted support for specific challenges
- Focus on one specific skill at a time for best results
