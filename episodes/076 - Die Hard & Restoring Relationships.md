## Restoring Relationships Cheat Sheet

### 1. Recognize When Relationships Need Attention
- Notice when work or other pursuits are creating distance between family members
- Pay attention to symbolic changes (like Holly changing her last name in the film) that indicate relationship strain
- Acknowledge when you're projecting your own fears or expectations onto family members
- Remember that career success doesn't necessarily equal family success
- Be honest when family relationships have become secondary to other priorities

### 2. Create Dedicated Time for Important Relationships
- Consider keeping kids in childcare occasionally to maintain couple relationship (like Nick and his wife do during holidays)
- Set aside specific days to reconnect with your partner
- Use holiday breaks to "soak up" time with children and repair any disconnects
- Don't wait for "spare time" to appearâ€”intentionally schedule relationship maintenance
- Recognize that quality relationship time rarely happens without planning

### 3. Reflect and Plan Together
- Take time to discuss how the past year has affected your relationship
- Plan your priorities for the coming year as a family unit
- Have conversations about what's working and what needs to change
- Use structured time (like Nick's annual two days with his wife) to have deeper conversations
- Create rituals around relationship reflection and planning

### 4. Balance Individual Growth with Family Connection

- Use holidays to emphasize relationship over consumption
- Understand that affluence and career success don't replace the need for family connection

### 6. Repair Damaged Relationships

- Look for symbolic ways to demonstrate renewed commitment (like Holly reclaiming the McClane name)

- Don't let pride prevent you from rebuilding important relationships
- Remember that even deeply strained relationships can often be restored with effort
