# Episode 14: Parenthood & Sensitive Kids Part 2
## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss strategies for supporting sensitive children, in the context of the film "Parenthood" (1989). This is a follow-up "reflective practice" episode to their previous discussion on sensitive kids, where they address listener questions and feedback. They explore the differences between "orchid" children (sensitive, with big emotional responses) and "dandelion" children (more resilient), while emphasizing that the goal isn't to change a child's temperament but to give them skills to succeed. Billy and Nick share personal examples and respond to listener questions about balancing attention between children, helping sensitive kids connect with peers, and building self-esteem.

## Supporting Sensitive Children Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Your Child's Temperament
- Recognize the distinction between "orchid" children (sensitive, big emotions) and "dandelion" children (resilient, adaptable)
- Look for specific challenges your sensitive child faces rather than general sensitivity
- Remember that sensitivity isn't a weakness—it can be a strength when properly supported
- Observe how quickly your child bounces back from emotional challenges
- Understand that temperament is innate but the skills to manage it can be taught

### 2. Creating Connection During Difficult Moments
- Focus on physical presence and non-verbal connection when your child is struggling
- Instead of saying "you're okay," try "I'm here" to acknowledge their feelings
- Recognize that staying present when a child is upset is valuable even when they don't calm down immediately
- Allow children to express difficult emotions rather than trying to stop them
- Remember that connecting during happy moments is easy—the true test is connecting during struggles

### 3. Setting Children Up For Social Success
- Keep early play dates short, structured, and positive
- Provide more scaffolding for sensitive children in social situations
- Prepare children for potentially challenging environments (like arcades or busy playgrounds)
- Check in regularly during social events to see how they're coping
- Give children language to use when they need help ("If something happens, come find me")

### 4. Creating "Sanctuaries" For Each Child
- Establish consistent, protected activities that happen regularly with each child
- Make these activities "untouchable"—they happen regardless of other circumstances
- Create sanctuaries between siblings as well as between parent and child
- Use these times to reinforce that relationships trump everything else
- Find unique connections that work for each child (reading quietly, active play, etc.)

### 5. Building Self-Esteem Through Targeted Success
- Set specific, achievable goals rather than vague hopes for improvement
- Focus on creating positive experiences rather than just avoiding negative ones
- Identify activities where your sensitive child can shine and build confidence
- Use extracurricular activities to create successful peer experiences outside of school
- Celebrate their sensitivity as a strength by giving them special roles that utilize it

### 6. Developing Emotional Literacy
- Create regular family check-ins about emotions (like using Italian words: male/così così/bellissimo)
- Model appropriate emotional expression yourself
- Respond supportively to children's emotional expressions
- Help children identify and name their feelings
- Remember that verbally advanced children may still be developing emotionally

### 7. Balancing Attention Between Children
- Recognize that sensitive children may need more support at times
- Ensure each child gets focused, quality time with parents
- Look for ways siblings can support each other's development
- Acknowledge different parenting approaches between co-parents
- Remember that what matters is connection, not equal time distribution
