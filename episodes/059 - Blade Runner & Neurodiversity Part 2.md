## Supporting Neurodivergent Children Cheat Sheet

### 1. Supporting Social Relationships
- Identify specific social skills your child struggles with (initiating vs. maintaining friendships, sharing, perspective-taking)
- Create scaffolded social experiences with appropriate support levels - be present and guide interactions
- Keep social interactions short, successful, and positive initially
- Find environments where your child feels comfortable and confident, then gradually introduce peers into those settings
- Seek professional help from occupational therapists or speech pathologists for targeted skill development
- Remember: the goal isn't changing who they are, but helping them share their unique selves with others

### 2. Addressing Masking Behaviors
- Recognize that masking (hiding natural behaviors to fit in) is exhausting and a risk factor for mental health problems
- Create safe spaces where children can be themselves without judgment
- Work with teachers and caregivers to create accommodations that allow genuine self-expression
- Teach alternative coping mechanisms that are socially acceptable while still meeting needs
- Watch for children who appear fine at school but "explode" at home - this often indicates masking
- Help children understand that different environments may have different expectations without implying something is wrong with them

### 3. Balancing Family Needs Between Neurodivergent and Neurotypical Children
- Protect one-on-one time with each child, especially those who don't demand attention through behaviors
- Be cautious about relying too heavily on more flexible siblings' adaptability
- Create "sanctuary time" with neurotypical siblings where they receive your undivided attention
- Use extended family and support networks to ensure all children's needs are met
- Watch for signs that quieter children are suppressing their own needs because others seem to need more help
- Validate all children's experiences and emotions, regardless of where they fall on the neurodiversity spectrum

### 4. Navigating Social Challenges and Public Perceptions
- Find communities that celebrate your child's uniqueness instead of trying to change everyone's perspective
- Use educational resources (like podcasts, books) to help friends and family understand rather than always explaining yourself
- Focus on relationships where your child is accepted rather than trying to force traditional social connections
- Remember that your responsibility is to your child's wellbeing, not to educate everyone you meet
- For difficult public situations, have prepared strategies (quick exits, calming techniques) but avoid feeling embarrassed
- Consider organized social skills groups where children practice with peers who are also developing these skills

### 5. Balancing Accommodation with Resilience Development
- Create a "safe harbor" home environment while gradually exposing children to challenging situations
- Don't accept dysfunction as inevitable - seek to understand underlying causes when children struggle
- Differentiate between neurodiversity (difference) and dysfunction (struggle) - accommodation shouldn't replace addressing needs
- Provide support that stretches abilities gradually rather than avoiding all difficult situations
- Remember that the goal is eventual independence, which requires opportunities to practice difficult skills
- Seek professional help from specialists like occupational therapists when children struggle significantly with specific skills
- Focus on specific challenges rather than general "resilience building" - identify exactly what skill needs strengthening
