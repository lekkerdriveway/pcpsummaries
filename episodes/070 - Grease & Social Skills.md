# Episode 70: Grease & Social Skills

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss children's social skills development across different ages, in the context of the film "Grease." They explore the distinction between emotional skills and social skills, explaining that emotional regulation is a prerequisite for social skill development. The hosts break down how social skills evolve from early infant interactions through to teenage peer relationships and deeper friendships. Using a scene from Grease where Danny behaves differently with Sandy when his friends are present, they illustrate how social pressures impact behavior and the importance of developmentally appropriate expectations for children's social abilities.

## Social Skills Development Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Early Social Skills (0-3 years)
- Social skills begin developing from birth through reciprocal interactions like eye contact and "serve and return" exchanges
- Babies as young as 10 weeks will mimic facial expressions and develop early social reciprocity
- Early signs of empathy emerge before age one when babies respond to other babies crying
- Look for development of nonverbal social skills like gestures and facial expressions around 2-3 years
- Model and narrate facial expressions: "Is that person happy or sad?" to build emotional recognition

### 2. Supporting Preschool Social Development (3-5 years)
- Sharing typically begins to develop between 2-3 years of age
- Red flag: By 3-4 years, children should show interest in other children and begin sharing
- Practice specific social skills like sharing when children are calm, not during emotional dysregulation
- Scaffold turn-taking through structured activities and clear verbal guidance
- Use imaginative play to practice specific challenging social scenarios (like standing up for yourself)
- Remember: School readiness is more about social skills than academic abilities

### 3. Building Primary School Connections (5-10 years)
- Parents remain the biggest influence on social development until ages 8-9
- Ask teachers: "How does my child play with others?" during early primary years
- Teach conversation starters: "What's your favorite color?" for connecting with peers
- Help children learn to shift topics in conversation rather than fixating on one interest
- Support the transition from parallel play to interactive play with shared goals
- Create opportunities for positive social experiences where children can practice and succeed

### 4. Developing Deeper Relationships (10+ years)
- Around ages 10-12, peer relationships become more influential than parent relationships
- Friendships develop three levels of depth: acquaintances, friends with shared interests, and close friends
- Self-disclosure (sharing personal vulnerabilities) is a key skill for developing deeper friendships
- Guide appropriate self-disclosure—neither oversharing too early nor never opening up
- Help children recognize and appreciate personality qualities in friends beyond surface interests
- Use questions rather than statements to help children reflect on relationships: "Isn't he a really good helper?"

### 5. Modeling Pro-Social Behaviors
- Children learn primarily through imitation of adults' social interactions
- Model altruistic behaviors—children who see parents helping others are more likely to help others themselves
- Share appropriate personal experiences to demonstrate healthy self-disclosure
- Demonstrate positive social media and digital communication when relevant
- Remember: Pro-social skills like caring and empathy are strong predictors of future life success
- The goal is to build skills for when you're not present—they need independent social capability
