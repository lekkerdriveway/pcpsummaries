## Building Children's Resilience Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding True Resilience
- Resilience is not just "toughening up" (85% of listeners were told this growing up)
- Resilience involves having healthy mechanisms to respond to stress and negativity
- Distinguish between resilience (responding well to challenges) and persistence (just getting through)
- Children aren't strong because of adversity - trauma doesn't make children stronger
- True resilience is proven through how they handle adversity, not by creating unnecessary hardship

### 2. Perspective-Taking & Generosity
- Help children recognize others' emotions: "I wonder what they might be feeling right now?"
- Prompt children to notice perspectives before telling them what to do
- Create opportunities for children to practice generosity
- Reinforce generous behaviors when they occur naturally
- Use stories, books, and imaginative play to explore generosity and perspective-taking

### 3. Processing Past Difficulties
- Discuss past challenges when the timing is appropriate (not during active distress)
- Remind children how they overcame previous difficulties: "Remember how tough that was? What did you do to get better?"
- Ask open-ended questions about their feelings: "How do you feel looking back at that time?"
- Share their progress since difficult events to build confidence
- Use specific examples from their life rather than generic encouragement

### 4. Supporting Neurodivergent Children
- Balance protection with opportunities for growth and development
- Recognize that neurodivergent children may not be seen, heard, or understood by others
- Adjust expectations to match their specific needs rather than trying to fit them into neurotypical standards
- The burden of adaptation should be on society, not on the neurodivergent child
- Provide appropriate support while still allowing for growth-promoting challenges

### 5. Teaching Skills Through Connection
- Apply the same patience and support to emotional skills as you would physical skills (like learning to ride a bike)
- When children "fall down emotionally," help them up rather than coming down hard on them
- Focus on one specific skill at a time rather than broad concepts like "being resilient"
- Build connections before correction: comfort first, teach later
- Model healthy emotional responses to your own challenges

### 6. Mental Health Considerations
- Mental health conditions add extra "weight" that individuals carry
- Avoid stigmatizing or blaming those with mental health challenges
- Recognize that resilience looks different for everyone based on their unique challenges
- Communities should help lift the burden rather than expecting individuals to "just get over it"
- Acknowledge the extra resilience required when dealing with mental health conditions

### 7. Developing Resilience Through Relationship
- Strong, secure attachments provide the foundation for resilience
- Create a sense of belonging and connection within the family
- Allow children appropriate independence while providing support
- Celebrate small successes rather than focusing only on challenges
- Remember that healing happens in relationship - children learn resilience through their connections with caring adults
