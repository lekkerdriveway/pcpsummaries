## Fostering Healthy Friendships Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Social Development Milestones
- Social development begins in infancy with social smiling (around 6 weeks) and social referencing (looking to caregivers for emotional cues)
- Around age 1, children engage in "parallel play" alongside others without true interaction
- By ages 5-6, children develop better understanding of others' perspectives and form actual friendships
- Primary school years are crucial for friendship development and building self-esteem
- Teenage friendships become more complex as adolescents practice adult relationship skills

### 2. Creating Social Opportunities
- Provide safe, supervised environments where children can practice social skills with your guidance
- Seek a middle ground between complete safety (with parents) and independent peer interactions
- Structured activities like swimming lessons create scaffolded social opportunities
- Extracurricular activities offer the "sweet spot" between highly structured classroom and unstructured playground
- Help children identify their unique skills that make them valuable within friendship groups

### 3. Supporting Perspective-Taking
- Use "Socratic dialogue" - ask questions rather than providing answers about others' feelings
- When conflicts arise, prompt children with "Why do you think they did that?" rather than explaining others' behavior
- Help children think about another's perspective without telling them what the other child was feeling
- This teaches the skill of perspective-taking rather than just the answer to a specific situation
- Recognize that this ability develops gradually from ages 5-6 but can be limited when emotions run high

### 4. Modeling Healthy Relationships
- Children don't distinguish between parent-child relationships and peer relationships as examples
- How you treat your child becomes their template for how people treat each other
- Demonstrate conflict resolution, emotional regulation, and respect in your own interactions
- Warmth trumps everything - being receptive, accepting and warm is the foundation of social connection
- Avoid contradicting your message (like punishing hitting by hitting)

### 5. Responding to Social Struggles
- Focus on having at least one good friendship rather than popularity
- When children share friendship problems, respond with warmth and acceptance, not judgment
- Avoid dismissing, ignoring or responding angrily to social concerns
- Recognize that children who haven't had social opportunities (like daycare or structured activities) may struggle initially
- Understand that social pain activates the same brain regions as physical pain - social exclusion genuinely hurts

### 6. Nurturing Teen Social Development
- Create an environment where teens feel comfortable bringing social concerns to you
- Maintain open communication by accepting their experiences without judgment
- Focus on genuine connections rather than popularity
- Help teens understand that friendships based on authentic shared interests are most likely to endure
- Be patient through periods when teens push away, while maintaining warmth and availability

### 7. Building Social Resilience
- Strong friendships protect against negative effects of bullying and social exclusion
- Help children develop prosocial behaviors (caring, sharing, comforting, supporting)
- Teach and model how to maintain friendships, not just how to make them
- Encourage children to stand up for others when witnessing social exclusion
- Remember that social competence is one of the strongest predictors of adult mental and physical health
