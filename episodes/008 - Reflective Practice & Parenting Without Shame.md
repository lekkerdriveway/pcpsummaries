## Parenting Without Shame Cheat Sheet

### 1. Ask Yourself Key Questions Before Reacting
- "What's going on for them?" - Consider the child's perspective and emotional state
- "What have I missed?" - Assess the environment and context before jumping to conclusions
- "Have I pitched this too high?" - Reflect on whether your expectations are age-appropriate
- These questions are for you as the parent, not interrogation questions for your child
- Pause and consider alternatives before "coming in hot" to a situation

### 2. Focus on Behaviors, Not the Child's Character
- Never challenge who the child is as a person (avoid labels like "you're naughty/bad")
- Reinforce their strengths and positive identity while addressing specific behaviors
- Separate the behavior from the child: "That behavior isn't helpful" vs. "You are bad"
- Remember there's an emotion beneath every behavior - identify what's really happening
- Use language that maintains the child's dignity while addressing the issue

### 3. Consider Alternative Explanations
- Challenge your initial negative interpretations of a child's behavior
- Ask yourself: "What else might be true about this situation?"
- Consider factors like hunger, tiredness, developmental stage, or recent events
- Look for patterns in when challenging behaviors occur (time of day, circumstances)
- This approach comes from evidence-based anxiety management techniques

### 4. Model Making and Recovering from Mistakes
- Show children that everyone makes mistakes, including adults
- Share your own mistakes and how you addressed them
- Focus on the recovery process rather than the mistake itself
- Consider family practices like discussing "a mistake I made today" at dinner
- Demonstrate that mistakes are opportunities for growth, not sources of shame

### 5. Create Positive Feedback Loops
- Notice and comment on what's going well: "We're getting so good at our morning routine"
- Use collaborative language: "We're in this together" rather than "You need to do better"
- Recognize small improvements rather than expecting perfection
- Remember that "rewarding is rewarding" - it feels good to focus on positives
- Be realistic: you won't nail perfect parenting every time, and that's okay

### Additional Insights
- Children don't need manufactured adversity - real life provides enough challenges
- Some children are more sensitive than others and require different approaches
- The child decides what experiences are traumatic for them, not the parent
- Punitive approaches often create negative spirals where behaviors worsen
- Parents should be kind to themselves and recognize that changing habits takes time
