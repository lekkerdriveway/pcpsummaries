## Fostering Healthy Sibling Relationships Cheat Sheet

### 1. Building Bonded Relationships
- Focus on creating bonded relationships rather than competitive ones
- Provide opportunities for siblings to engage in imaginative play together without parent direction
- Create protected time for siblings to bond where there aren't friends over to challenge their connection
- Help siblings identify what they enjoy about each other and celebrate their similarities
- Remember: siblings potentially have the longest relationships in our lives—longer than with parents or friends

### 2. Managing Conflict Effectively
- Intervene during "the climb" to conflict rather than waiting until it's fully escalated
- Teach communication signals and boundaries, especially for physical play
- Create clear guidelines for rough play: where it happens, how to start, how to stop
- Be curious about what's driving the behavior rather than being punitive
- Guide children toward specific behaviors you want to see rather than just saying "no"

### 3. Balancing Attention and Support
- Prioritize equity (giving each child what they need) over equality (giving each child the same)
- Ensure the child requiring less attention still gets what they need, even while supporting a higher-needs sibling
- Focus on quality interactions rather than equal time with each child
- Identify when your energy levels are highest and use that time for challenging sibling dynamics
- Accept that you can't always meet the needs of multiple children simultaneously—and that's okay

### 4. Handling Jealousy and Competition
- Validate the emotional experience when a child feels jealous rather than dismissing it
- Create opportunities for each child to have a leadership role in something they excel at
- Avoid creating narratives where one child is "good" at something and the other isn't
- Provide specific, targeted praise about contributions each child makes to the family
- Focus on building secure (not high) self-esteem in moments outside of sibling comparisons

### 5. Supporting New Sibling Transitions
- Prepare older siblings but don't put pressure on the first introduction
- Be aware of your own feelings when attention shifts away from your first child
- Protect one-on-one time with each child, especially when a new baby arrives
- Recognize the potential for behavior escalation in toddlers when a new sibling arrives
- Help older children find their role with the younger sibling that isn't parental

### 6. Adjusting Expectations for Different Ages and Temperaments
- Remember that siblings at different developmental stages need different levels of support
- Younger siblings may show some development delays (especially in language) but usually catch up
- Siblings with neurodiversity may need different types of support than neurotypical siblings
- Tailor your parenting approach to each child's temperament rather than using one strategy for all
- Set developmentally appropriate expectations—if a strategy shows no improvement in 2-3 weeks, your expectations may be too high
