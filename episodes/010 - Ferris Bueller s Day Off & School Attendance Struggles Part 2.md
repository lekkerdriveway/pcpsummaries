## Supporting School Attendance Cheat Sheet

### 1. Setting Kids Up For Success In School Transitions
- Recognize major transitions (daycare, kindergarten, primary, high school) as vulnerable periods requiring extra support
- Build positive narratives about school before attendance begins
- Arrange early visits to new environments to familiarize children with settings
- Help children build relationships with staff and other students before full attendance
- Create clear expectations about attendance while acknowledging natural anxiety

### 2. Checking In Without Creating Pressure
- Ask specific questions rather than general "How was school today?"
- Focus on positives: "What was the best thing about school today?"
- Inquire about friendships: "Who did you play with at lunch?"
- Identify strengths: "What's something you're really good at at school?"
- Talk to teachers to find what your child excels at, even if they struggle academically
- Remember that the stories kids hear about themselves significantly impact who they become

### 3. Recognizing Signs of Struggle
- Watch for withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities
- Notice when children stop talking about friends or school learnings they used to mention
- Be alert to physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches) that may signal anxiety
- Recognize changes in sleep patterns or reluctance during morning routines
- Understand that teens may struggle to express concerns directly but might open up later in the evening

### 4. Supporting Parents' Mental Health
- Acknowledge that your own mental health directly impacts your child's school experience
- Seek help through your general practitioner (GP) who can provide referrals and pathways
- Consider talking to school staff about your own struggles—many schools have resources for parents
- Recognize that getting help for yourself models positive mental health behavior for your child
- Remember that treating your own anxiety or depression improves your capacity to support your child

### 5. Helping Children Already Refusing School
- Build an alliance with the school rather than trying to solve the problem alone
- Create gradual reintroduction plans (starting with one subject, half days, etc.) rather than demanding immediate full attendance
- Include the child in planning by identifying what they enjoy about school
- Set specific, measurable goals with clear timelines (e.g., "Over the next month, we will...")
- Maintain regular communication with teachers if the plan isn't working
- Seek professional help to understand underlying causes—children don't refuse school without reason

### 6. Finding Motivation For Return
- Help identify the child's own reasons for returning to school, not just yours or the school's
- Reinforce activities they enjoy (friends, specific subjects, sports)
- Frame return as a positive accomplishment rather than obligation
- Understand that school is crucial for social-emotional development, especially for teenagers
- Remember that successful school journeys are strong predictors of positive adult mental health outcomes
