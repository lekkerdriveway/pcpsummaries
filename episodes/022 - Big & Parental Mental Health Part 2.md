## Parental Mental Health Cheat Sheet

### 1. Supporting Someone Who Feels Alone
- Listen genuinely without immediately jumping to solutions or interrupting
- Learn about what they're experiencing through research (this shows real commitment to understanding)
- Help them find pathways to improve their mental health situation
- Recognize the difference between actually being alone and feeling alone despite having support
- Create opportunities for connection that don't feel forced or overwhelming

### 2. Seeking Professional Help
- Understand that seeking professional support is a sign of strength, not weakness
- Utilize mental health care plans through your GP to access subsidized therapy sessions
- Consider both formal support (therapy, counseling) and informal support (friends, physical activity)
- Don't wait for a crisis - proactive mental health support can prevent larger problems
- Appreciate the value of having an objective, non-judgmental person to talk to without history or personal relationship dynamics

### 3. Behavioral Activation Strategy
- Recognize that depression often creates a cycle where low motivation prevents activities that would improve mood
- Do the behavior to get the feeling, not wait for the feeling to do the behavior
- Start small: even a short walk around the block when you'd rather stay in bed
- Monitor which activities genuinely improve your mental state versus those that don't
- Understand that improvement happens gradually, not overnight - consistency matters more than intensity

### 4. Protecting Your Protective Factors
- Identify what currently supports your mental health (relationships, exercise, meaningful activities)
- During difficult times, resist the urge to withdraw from these protective elements
- Continue investing energy in relationships and activities that bring stability even when facing challenges
- Recognize multiple sources of fulfillment rather than tying your identity to a single role
- Balance addressing current problems with maintaining protective elements in your life

### 5. Aiming for Contentment
- Understand that constant happiness is neither realistic nor necessary for good mental health
- Focus on contentment and satisfaction rather than pursuing persistent happiness
- Live according to your values rather than external measures of success
- Find meaningful engagement in multiple areas of life (not just work or parenting)
- Appreciate the practice or process of activities rather than focusing solely on outcomes

### 6. Reducing Mental Health Stigma
- Share personal experiences with mental health challenges when appropriate
- Normalize seeking help through open conversations about therapy and support
- Recognize that nearly 50% of adults will experience a clinical mental illness in their lifetime
- Support others by checking in regularly, especially during transitions or difficult periods
- Create environments where talking about mental health is as normal as discussing physical health
