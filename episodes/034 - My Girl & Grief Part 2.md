## Talking to Children About Grief Cheat Sheet

### 1. Be Led By The Child
- Follow the child's questions rather than overwhelming them with information
- Children will ask when they're ready to know more—you don't need to explain everything at once
- Remember that different ages understand death differently (by age 4-6, children begin to grasp that death happens to all living things)
- Create space for conversations but let them happen naturally, not just in formal "end of bed" talks
- Use everyday moments and their questions as opportunities to explain concepts gradually

### 2. Be Honest But Age-Appropriate
- Use clear, truthful language—avoid euphemisms like "gone to sleep" that can cause confusion
- For young children, explain death in terms of bodily functions: "the heart stops working," "the body stops moving"
- Only use religious concepts like heaven if they genuinely reflect your family's beliefs
- Don't overload with information beyond what they've asked for
- Be comfortable saying "I don't know" when you don't have answers

### 3. Explain Death in Developmental Stages
- Young children (4-6) first understand that all living things eventually die (universality)
- Children gradually learn that death is permanent (irreversibility)—expect repeated questions like "When is Grandma coming back?"
- Children initially find it easier to understand death happening to elderly people
- Expect children to need many conversations over time to fully process concepts
- Revisit explanations as children reach new developmental stages

### 4. Model Healthy Grieving 
- Let children see your emotions—putting on a brave face makes it harder for them to express their own feelings
- Show that it's normal to be sad, to cry, or to miss someone
- Share your own process while being mindful not to overwhelm them
- Demonstrate that grief is a natural response to loss
- Acknowledge that processing grief takes time for everyone, including adults

### 5. Create Meaningful Remembrance
- Involve children in deciding how to remember the person who died
- Share stories and memories to keep the person's memory alive
- Consider practical ways to maintain connections (photos, special items, traditions)
- Balance remembering with continuing daily life
- Allow children to develop their own relationship with the memory of the person

### 6. Supporting Teenagers Through Grief
- Create space for conversations without pressure to communicate
- Be accessible when they're ready to talk
- Recognize that sensitive or anxious teens may struggle more with fears about death
- Understand that teens may process grief differently than younger children
- Allow them to go at their own pace and express grief in their own way

### 7. When Explaining Death Is Particularly Difficult
- More sensitive children may need extra support through the grieving process
- Children may struggle more with understanding sudden or traumatic death versus old age
- Be prepared for children to transfer their anxiety to other concerns (like health worries)
- When explaining a sibling's death, be especially mindful of the surviving children's needs
- Remember there's no perfect way—you know your child best and can adjust your approach accordingly
