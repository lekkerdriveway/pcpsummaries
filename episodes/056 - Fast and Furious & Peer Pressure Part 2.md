## Supporting Children Through Peer Pressure Cheat Sheet

### 1. Building Foundations for Resilience
- Provide unconditional positive regard: separate behavior from relationship ("That behavior is unacceptable because you're better than that, but it doesn't change our relationship")
- Give children opportunities to have a voice, make choices, and develop autonomy
- Allow children to think differently from you—this builds confidence to think differently from peers later
- Foster self-worth through recognizing strengths and supporting identity development
- Create opportunities for stable, supportive relationships with adults beyond parents (coaches, teachers, family friends)

### 2. Role Modeling Relationship Values
- Demonstrate through your actions what good friendships look like—children watch how you treat people and which relationships you value
- Be mindful of the traits you praise in others—if you admire someone despite poor behavior, children may think that trait trumps treating others well
- Examine your own friendships for the messages they send—do you tolerate people treating you poorly?
- Avoid saying one thing but demonstrating another (like telling children not to gossip while gossiping yourself)
- Show children that how people treat others matters more than their popularity, wealth, or achievements

### 3. Creating Positive Peer Environments
- Intentionally create opportunities for positive peer pressure through structured activities like sports, arts, or community service
- Look for peer communities where children can find support and motivation (like Nick's martial arts community)
- Help children identify when peer groups are having a positive influence on their goals and values
- Recognize that cultural context affects peer pressure—consider ways to increase community involvement
- For neurodivergent children, focus on social skills training to help navigate peer relationships

### 4. Navigating "Dibby-Dobber" Dilemmas
- Teach children the difference between reporting dangerous situations (important) and tattling for minor issues
- Guide children through resolving conflicts: "I appreciate you telling me, but it would be even more awesome if you could find the answer together"
- Watch how children handle conflict resolution and adjust your approach if you notice their relationships aren't strengthening
- Help children develop skills to resolve conflicts independently as preparation for teenage years
- Remember that rigidly following rules at the expense of relationships can isolate children socially

### 5. Supporting Identity Development
- Encourage children to reflect on their own values and opinions before adopting peers' viewpoints
- Talk openly about peer pressure situations—both hypothetical scenarios and real examples
- Discuss media examples of peer pressure (like Fast and Furious) to spark conversations
- Acknowledge that stable family relationships provide security when exploring identity
- Remember that peer relationships are crucial for development—even with their challenges, children need peer experiences to develop social skills
