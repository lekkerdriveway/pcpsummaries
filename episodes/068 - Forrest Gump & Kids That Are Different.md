## Creating True Inclusion for Different Kids Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding and Responding to Differences
- Avoid defining children by their disabilities or challenges (like Forrest Gump wasn't defined by his IQ of 75)
- When children make comments about differences, respond factually and neutrally: "His eyelid doesn't open all the way like yours or mine" rather than getting defensive
- Children often lack vocabulary to express differences, so they use words like "weird" - respond with facts, not judgment
- Remember it's not your responsibility to use every interaction as an educational moment, especially in stressful situations
- For young children, it's appropriate to protect them from harshness while gradually helping them understand their differences

### 2. Finding and Elevating Strengths
- Actively identify what each child enjoys and what they're good at (specific skills, not generic traits)
- Create opportunities where these strengths can shine and contribute meaningfully to group activities
- In settings like dance class or sports, find roles that highlight abilities rather than emphasizing limitations
- Look beyond traditional participation methods - a child who can't physically dance might have other valuable contributions to the performance
- The goal is to make everyone feel, "We couldn't do this without you" - true inclusion means valuable participation

### 3. Supporting Your Child Through Difficult Encounters
- Physically be present with your child during challenging situations to prevent them feeling alone
- Create safe spaces after difficult encounters to discuss and validate emotions
- Help children understand that others' comments reflect the commenters' limitations, not their worth
- Start conversations about differences at age-appropriate levels - it's never too early to begin simple discussions
- Connect with your child's healthcare providers for guidance on explaining differences to your child

### 4. Creating Inclusive Communities
- Proactively build relationships with school staff and other parents to address inclusion before problems arise
- Role model inclusive behavior for other parents and children in playgrounds and social settings
- Share stories that elevate the positive attributes of children with differences
- Advocate for meaningful accommodations rather than token inclusion or separate activities
- Remember that inclusion benefits all children, not just those with disabilities - everyone learns valuable life skills

### 5. Building Connections Between Children
- Scaffold interactions between children based on shared interests rather than focusing on differences
- Help children find common ground: "You both really enjoy this game - let's play it together"
- Encourage specific compliments: "I really enjoy playing this with you because you're good at strategy"
- Create cooperative activities where different strengths are needed for success
- Remember that children follow adults' lead - your comfort and natural approach to differences sets the tone
