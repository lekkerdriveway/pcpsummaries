## Supporting Children's Friendships Cheat Sheet

### 1. Helping Shy Children Build Friendships
- Find the "sweet spot" between respecting their slower-to-warm temperament and creating opportunities for social engagement
- Practice and role-play conversation initiators and social skills at home before real situations
- Create passive opportunities for interaction rather than pushing direct engagement
- Scaffold social interactions by setting up playdates with familiar children first
- Positively reinforce any social attempts: "I noticed you asked that child if you could join in—that was really brave"
- Be mindful of your own anxiety about their social interactions, as children look to parents for cues
- Focus on gradual progress rather than dramatic social transformation

### 2. Addressing Social Exclusion
- Listen without judgment to understand what happened in their exclusion experience
- Look for opportunities to strengthen the child's prosocial skills if needed
- Create structured activities where exclusion isn't an option and inclusion is the goal
- For coaches/teachers: Implement activities where everyone has a meaningful role
- Watch for changes in behavior (less talk about friends, reluctance to attend activities) as potential signs of exclusion
- Communicate with educators who observe peer dynamics regularly
- Form alliances between parents, teachers, and other adults to create a "safety net" around the child
- Help the child identify ways to re-engage with the group in a protected, positive way

### 3. Maintaining Friendships During Relocations
- Recognize that primary school years (especially ages 9-11) and teenage years can be more challenging times to move
- Help maintain connections with old friends through video chats, online communities, and periodic visits
- Find activities the child enjoys (like sports) where they can quickly understand social norms in a new environment
- Signal early that you'll work together to protect important friendships
- Include children in discussions about moves and acknowledge their feelings
- Create continuity by finding similar activities in the new location
- Understand that relocations can develop valuable social skills despite challenges

### 4. Handling Friendship Fallouts
- Create space for children to talk about what happened rather than dismissing their feelings
- Use open-ended questions: "What happened?" "How did that make you feel?"
- Validate their emotional experience: "That sounds really hard"
- Practice perspective-taking: "Why do you think they got upset?"
- For young children, offer simple problem-solving guidance: "What might be a way to show Samantha you'd still like to be friends?"
- Identify specific social skills they might need to develop (e.g., turn-taking, sharing)
- Set up structured opportunities to practice these skills
- Celebrate progress in resolving conflicts: "I noticed you worked it out together—that was really impressive"
- Use conflicts as opportunities to develop empathy and conflict resolution skills for later life

### 5. Navigating "Undesirable" Friendships
- Recognize there are no "bad kids"—only kids who may engage in challenging behaviors
- Understand that children seek connection above all else in friendships
- Focus on building your child's ability to maintain their boundaries and values rather than prohibiting friendships
- Create alternative social opportunities that provide healthy connection
- Welcome your child's friends into your home to provide positive influence and modeling
- Teach assertiveness skills so children can say "no" when uncomfortable with peers' behaviors
- Look for underlying issues like low self-esteem that might draw children to problematic peer groups
- Model respect for all people while setting clear expectations for behavior

### 6. Supporting Twins' Friendships
- Understand that twins often develop strong prosocial skills from their built-in peer relationship
- Recognize that most twins don't struggle to make friends—their twin relationship often enhances social development
- Provide some opportunities for separate social experiences as they grow older
- Don't worry excessively about twins being "too close"—this connection is usually beneficial
- Support the maintenance of their individual interests and relationships
- Appreciate that their shared understanding can be protective and supportive
- Know that twins often share peer groups but can also benefit from some distinct social connections

### 7. Supporting Children with Mental Health Issues in Friendships
- Prioritize gradual reintroduction to peer relationships alongside treatment for mental health issues
- Start with small, achievable social goals rather than full reengagement
- Find "hooks" (shared interests) that can facilitate social connection with less pressure
- Begin with simply being in spaces where peers gather without expectations of interaction
- Celebrate small steps toward social engagement
- Understand withdrawal from friendships is often part of mental health struggles but reconnection is crucial for recovery
- Recognize that seeing children enjoy friendships again is often a powerful sign of healing
