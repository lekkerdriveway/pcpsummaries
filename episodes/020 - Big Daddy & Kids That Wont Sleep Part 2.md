## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss strategies for helping children who struggle with sleep, in the context of the Adam Sandler film "Big Daddy." They respond to listener feedback about children who have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep throughout the night. Billy explains the evidence-based approach of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) and breaks down its five key components, while Nick shares his personal experiences with his children's sleep challenges.

## Sleep Solutions Cheat Sheet

### 1. Sleep Hygiene Fundamentals
- Keep the bedroom dark and cool (temperature naturally rises during sleep)
- Establish a consistent bedtime routine (e.g., bath, book, bed)
- Set an alarm for bedtime, not just for waking up
- Maintain the same sleep schedule every night, including weekends
- Limit screen time before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin production)

### 2. Stimulus Control
- Strengthen the association between bedroom and sleeping
- Weaken the association between bedroom and being awake/alert
- Avoid playing games or other stimulating activities in the bedroom
- Use the "20-minute rule": if a child doesn't fall asleep within 20 minutes, take them out of the room briefly
- Implement bedtime fading: start with a later bedtime when they're visibly tired, then gradually move it earlier

### 3. Sleep Restriction
- Limit time in bed to actual sleep time (e.g., if child spends 10 hours in bed but only sleeps 7, restrict to 7 hours)
- Once they're sleeping for most of their time in bed (85-90%), gradually extend by 15-30 minutes weekly
- If nighttime wakings increase, reduce time in bed again temporarily
- This strengthens the association between bed and sleep

### 4. Mindfulness and Relaxation
- Teach age-appropriate mindfulness techniques
- For younger children: practice clenching and releasing fists while describing sensations
- For older children: try body scans (focusing attention on different body parts)
- Practice diaphragmatic breathing (counting breaths in and out)
- Introduce these techniques during the day first, then incorporate into bedtime routine

### 5. Behavior Change Strategies
- Identify the child's motivation for better sleep (not just yours)
- Set achievable targets and build positive reinforcement
- Use "bedtime passes" - give child 1-2 passes they can use to come out once for water/bathroom/brief chat
- Avoid negative reinforcement cycles (responding to shouting reinforces the behavior)
- Gradually reduce support (e.g., move from lying with child to sitting nearby, then to doorway, then outside)
- Celebrate small successes rather than punishing setbacks

### Additional Notes
- All children wake multiple times per night; self-soothing is the skill of linking sleep cycles
- Melatonin only helps with falling asleep, not staying asleep
- Melatonin is most effective for children with neurological conditions affecting circadian rhythm
- Improving sleep can significantly reduce symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and other conditions
- Be patient - consistent application of these strategies takes time but yields results
