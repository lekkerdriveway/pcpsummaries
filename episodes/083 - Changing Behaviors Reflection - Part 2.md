# Episode 83: Changing Behaviors Reflection - Part 2

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss strategies for addressing challenging behaviors across different developmental stages, from babies to teenagers. This is the second reflection episode (part 3 overall) on the topic of changing behaviors, with the hosts responding to numerous listener questions and feedback. The discussion covers a wide range of common parenting challenges including handling meltdowns, repetitive behaviors in autistic children, physical aggression, praise sensitivity, and motivating teenagers. Billy emphasizes the importance of connection before correction, understanding the child's perspective, and replacing unwanted behaviors rather than just trying to stop them. The episode provides practical, actionable strategies for maintaining calm during challenging moments and building children's skills to manage their emotions.

## Changing Behaviors Cheat Sheet

### 1. Maintaining Calm During Challenging Moments
- Notice physical signs of your own stress (tense muscles, clenched jaw)
- Use "Plan B" when needed - sometimes dropping expectations temporarily helps everyone reset
- Take a breath and remember that escalating will make the situation worse
- Create space between the trigger and your response when possible
- Reduce pressure on yourself and your child during already stressful times (mornings, bedtime)

### 2. Understanding the Purpose Behind Behaviors
- Look for what might be triggering repetitive or challenging behaviors
- For repetitive behaviors in autistic children, determine if they stem from joy/excitement or are serving as a "safe haven" from overwhelming sensations
- For physical aggression (like hitting siblings), consider underlying needs (attention, connection)
- With older children who resist everything (PDA), focus on finding shared interests before attempting to change behavior
- Observe patterns to identify when behaviors occur and what needs they might be fulfilling

### 3. Building Connection Before Correction
- "Stand next to them, run with them, then turn them" - align with your child before trying to redirect
- For resistant children, establish rapport and connection first before addressing behavior
- With teens, focus on understanding their perspective before sharing yours
- Validate children's feelings even when you don't agree with their behaviors
- For babies under 12 months, prioritize attachment through imitation and responsiveness

### 4. Replacing Unwanted Behaviors
- Focus on "do this instead" rather than "stop doing that"
- For sensory-seeking children, offer appropriate alternatives that meet similar sensory needs
- When children resort to screaming/squealing, gradually build their verbal communication skills during calm moments
- Teach specific rules around rough play rather than eliminating it ("check if everyone's having fun")
- For teens with risky behaviors (like vaping), identify meaningful motivators for change rather than imposing restrictions

### 5. Creating Opportunities for Success
- Ensure children experience success in activities they care about to build willingness to try difficult things
- For children who seem unmotivated or self-sabotaging, find areas where they can succeed first
- With older children who seek peer validation, create environments where they can practice social skills in safe settings
- For children sensitive to praise, adjust your approach (more subtle recognition, private acknowledgment)
- Scaffold opportunities for children to practice skills they're developing rather than expecting immediate mastery

### 6. Supporting Parents Through Challenges
- Recognize that parent mental health impacts children but can be addressed at any age
- Prioritize quality connection time during difficult phases
- When children are aggressive, ensure safety first, then focus on regulation and connection
- Remember that changing behaviors takes time and consistency
- Acknowledge the emotional toll of challenging behaviors and seek support when needed
