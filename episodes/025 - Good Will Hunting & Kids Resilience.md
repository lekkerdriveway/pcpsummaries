## Building Children's Resilience Cheat Sheet

### 1. Focus on Relationships
- Establish at least one positive, consistent relationship in a child's life
- Prioritize connection before attempting to teach skills
- Remember that relationship security comes before academic or behavioral expectations
- Maintain unconditional positive regard - show that your relationship transcends behavior
- Support peer relationships as they become increasingly protective as children grow older

### 2. Build on Strengths Rather Than Deficits
- Use tools like the VIA Character Strengths test to identify children's natural strengths

### 3. Establish Safety Through Rituals and Routines
- Implement consistent family rituals to increase sense of belonging and security
- Create predictable routines that children can rely on during challenging times
- Understand that the specific ritual doesn't matter as much as its consistency

- Create individualized plans based on where children are, not where you think they "should" be
- Recognize that children who experience adversity may have already used up their resilience resources
