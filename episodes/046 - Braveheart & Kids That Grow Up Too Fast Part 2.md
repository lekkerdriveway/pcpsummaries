# Episode 46: Braveheart & Kids That Grow Up Too Fast (Part 2)

## Episode Summary
In this episode Billy and Nick discuss strategies for helping children who have grown up too fast, in the context of the film "Braveheart." This is the second part of their two-part discussion on this topic, where they address specific questions from listeners about preventing children from growing up too quickly, balancing adversity with protection, and supporting children who have already experienced developmental disruptions. Billy explains the neurodevelopmental pathways that can be affected when children miss crucial developmental stages, and emphasizes that it's never too late to repair these pathways through purposeful intervention. Throughout the episode, they provide practical guidance for parents on how to identify and address developmental gaps in both children and themselves.

## Supporting Healthy Development Cheat Sheet

### 1. Preventing Kids From Growing Up Too Fast
- Recognize that brain development progresses in order from brain stem (basic functions) to higher cortex (complex thinking)
- Create positive "wiring" by responding consistently to a child's distress signals at all ages
- Match expectations to developmental level, not chronological age (especially for bright children)
- Don't be fooled by articulate children who may use complex language but still need emotional support
- Give children consistent opportunities to develop social skills with appropriate support levels
- Maintain a "clan" of supportive adults around children to provide stability even when parents are exhausted

### 2. Understanding Healthy Challenge vs. Harmful Adversity
- Children need appropriate challenges and opportunities to stretch their skills, not total protection
- Create gradually increasing challenges that match their developmental readiness
- Provide scaffolded support when introducing new challenges (like climbing higher slides)
- Balance protection with opportunity—avoid both overprotection and pushing too hard
- Focus on teaching skills through challenge rather than expecting adversity to build character
- Remember that role-modeling how to handle difficulties teaches more than the difficulty itself
- Watch for when kids need to be stretched versus when they need more support

### 3. Supporting Children Who Have Grown Up Too Fast
- Identify where development may have been disrupted (it's often in basic regulation and safety)
- Go back to the developmental stage they missed, regardless of their current age
- Prioritize feelings of safety and security before trying to teach higher-order skills
- Use rhythm-based activities (walking, movement, music) to help regulate dysregulated children
- Provide predictable, responsive relationships that rewire stress response pathways
- Focus on one specific skill gap at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once
- Give consistent, frequent positive reinforcement when they practice new skills

### 4. Addressing Developmental Gaps in Adults
- Recognize that everyone has developmental gaps, even as adults
- Focus on areas where gaps are causing dysfunction in your life, not every possible deficit
- Identify specific skills to improve rather than vague goals (e.g., "active listening" instead of "social skills")
- Practice higher-level thinking by reappraising situations that trigger stress responses
- Use rhythm and regulation techniques that work for you when emotionally dysregulated
- Be patient with yourself—pathways formed early are harder but not impossible to rewire
- Model healthy acknowledgment of gaps for your children—perfection isn't the goal

### 5. Creating Developmental Opportunities in Everyday Life
- Use everyday conflicts between siblings as chances to teach regulation and communication
- Create environments where children can practice skills at their actual developmental level
- When you notice a child struggling with a skill, identify whether it's attention-seeking or skill-lacking
- Provide appropriate clan support when one parent is too exhausted to respond optimally
- Remember that healthy development happens in relationship with others, not in isolation
- Recognize that developmental progress is uneven—all children have stronger and weaker areas
- Watch for black-and-white thinking patterns that may indicate emotional development needs
