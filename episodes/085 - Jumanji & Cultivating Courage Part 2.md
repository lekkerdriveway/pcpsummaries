## Cultivating Courage Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Courage vs. Fear
- Courage isn't the absence of fear but facing fear with purpose
- Don't minimize your child's fears with phrases like "it'll be alright" or "don't worry about it"
- Instead, validate the feeling: "I understand you're scared about your game tomorrow"
- Help children identify what specifically they're afraid of through gentle questioning
- Remember that courage looks different for each child—for some, leaving their bedroom is an act of immense courage

### 2. Supporting Without Forcing
- Find the middle ground between avoidance and forcing children to "just do it"
- Use the phrase "I'm here" rather than "It's okay" to provide reassurance
- Create "opportunities with less demand and more support" when children say "I can't do it"
- If a fear is overwhelming (like school bus anxiety), it's okay to temporarily use "Plan B" while building skills
- Scaffold experiences—join them in the feared activity first, then gradually reduce your support

### 3. Modeling Courage Effectively
- Show children your own struggles with things that genuinely scare you
- Narrate your thought process: "I feel nervous about this, but here's how I'm handling it"
- Talk through your physical sensations, coping strategies, and recovery from setbacks
- For younger children (under 8-9), focus on modeling physical courage
- For older children, demonstrate moral courage through standing up for what's right

### 4. Building Skills Incrementally
- Identify what's causing the fear and break it down into smaller steps
- Point to previous successes that indicate they can handle the new challenge
- Practice similar but less threatening scenarios (e.g., ride public buses before tackling the school bus)
- Discuss potential outcomes (both positive and negative) and how to handle each scenario
- Focus on building mastery and competence in small doses before tackling bigger fears

### 5. Creating Courage-Supporting Environments
- Help children build communities where they feel supported and connected
- Encourage autonomy—children need to feel they have some control and voice
- Celebrate examples of courage in others, particularly moral and social courage
- Recognize that social expectations strongly influence courage—build positive community norms
- For issues like racism or bullying, ensure the child doesn't feel they must face it alone—engage the broader community

### 6. Developing Different Types of Courage
- For younger children (under 8), focus primarily on physical courage challenges
- Introduce moral and psychological courage gradually as children develop
- Recognize that social/moral courage is harder to teach than physical courage
- Help children understand appropriate risk assessment—courage isn't recklessness
- Remember that courage follows resilience—children need to heal from setbacks before facing similar fears again
