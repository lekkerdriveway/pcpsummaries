## Co-Parenting Cheat Sheet

### 1. Understanding Parenting Differences
- Accept that all parents will parent differently based on their own upbringing and natural strengths
- Identify and utilize each parent's unique strengths rather than forcing identical approaches
- Avoid falling into rigid "fun parent" vs. "disciplinarian" roles like in Mrs. Doubtfire
- Discuss and acknowledge which parenting tasks each person finds challenging or enjoyable
- Create balance so one person isn't always handling the difficult aspects (bedtime, discipline)

### 2. Building a United Front
- Maintain consistency on important issues especially for children who are struggling
- Don't undermine the other parent's authority in front of children
- Coordinate approaches for specific challenges (e.g., toileting, sleep issues, behavior problems)
- Remember children should not have to adapt to different rule systems between parents
- Use scheduled check-ins to review parenting strategies and make adjustments together

### 3. Managing Conflict Constructively
- Recognize the "spillover hypothesis" - relationship conflict affects parent-child relationships
- Understand that children absorb tension even when parents think they're hiding it
- It's okay to disagree in front of children, but demonstrate healthy resolution
- Children often blame themselves for parental conflict - explicitly counter this misconception
- Seek professional support early if struggling (relationship counseling can improve co-parenting)

### 4. Practicing Empathy
- Research shows empathy between co-parents is the strongest predictor of effective parenting
- Before expressing frustration, try to understand the other parent's perspective and challenges
- Use "perspective-taking" statements: "I wonder what it's like for you to..."
- Acknowledge the other parent's sacrifices and difficulties
- Remember both parents are likely doing their best with the resources they have

### 5. Affirming Each Other's Parenting
- Regularly point out specific things the other parent does well with the children
- Positive affirmation increases parental confidence and reinforces effective behavior
- Be specific: "I really appreciate how you always make breakfast fun for the kids"
- Create opportunities for each parent to shine in their areas of strength
- Support each other during inevitable parenting mistakes or "Griswold moments"

### 6. Co-Parenting After Separation
- Focus on "staying on the same page for the kids" rather than "staying together for the kids" 
- Never use children as messengers between households ("Tell your mom...")
- Avoid attempting to win children's favor or loyalty against the other parent
- Maintain similar routines, expectations and consequences across households
- Remember that children's well-being depends on relationships with both parents
- Separate your personal feelings about your ex from their role as your child's parent
